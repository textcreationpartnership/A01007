            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And all this you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to doe out of our owne authors. It is true <hi>Sir Humphrey,</hi> that a <hi>Ieſuit</hi> made

And ſome finding the taske ſoe hard, haue beene faine to turne about ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and tell vs it is not needfull for the Church to be viſible, which they proue,<note place="margin">God's arrow againſt God's enemyes by Hen Smith.

               </note> becauſe in the dayes of <hi>Elias</hi> it perished, as they ſay; for he ſaid he was left alone; and in the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyps</hi> it is ſaid, that <hi>the Woman shall fly into the deſert.</hi> Which ſay they is all one, as that <hi>the Church muſt be inuiſible.</hi> But you now, as it should ſeeme, taking your ſelf to bee ſomewhat a better man then others that haue gone before you, will needs take vpon you to shew where your Church was before <hi>Luther.</hi> Wherein you are ſoe glorious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that you ſtile your booke <hi>a ſafe way leadinge all Chriſtians to the true, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and Catholique faith, now profeſſed in the Church of England;</hi> and this you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to performe by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and confeſſions euen of your beſt

learned aduerſaries.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Which booke of yours, though it hath beene long out, and gained you much fame among ſome of your owne ſect, yet amonge Catholiques it hath ſeemed of ſoe ſmall account as noe man hath all this while thought it worth the anſwearing, thinking it the beſt way of anſweare for ſuch toyes to let them dye as they ſpringe: but ſince you not conceiuing this to bee the true reaſon of our ſilence, nor hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard to your owne credit which is leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe impaired by ſilence then writing, ſtand ſtill printing and reprinting this your wiſe peece of worke, I haue thought good to giue it ſome anſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. For though my intention at firſt, were only to ſatisfye a priuate freind, (which was ſomewhat ſtumbled with it) by gathering ſome few corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, whereby hee might gueſſe of the reſt; Yet coming to reade your booke, and finding the very choyce hard in ſuch aboundance of corruptions; and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that many conceiued highly thereof, the rather becauſe it was not
<pb facs="tcp:2521:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
anſweared, I reſolued vpon a little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re full anſweare, which might ſerue for ſatisfaction, not onely of that one freind, but of others alſo, who may ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue conceiued the like opinion of this your booke: the very title and firſt page eſpecially mouing mee therevnto, in which are contained ſoe great promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or rather ſoe great braggs, that if Sir <hi>Humphrey,</hi> you make them good, wee may well change your name from Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> to Sir <hi>Hercules;</hi> for it is more then an <hi>Herculian</hi> labour which you vndertake therein: if you doe not, I preſume you wilbe content to change your ſurname of <hi>Lynde</hi> to another word, not farre different in ſound, as beginning with the two firſt letters the ſame, and more ſutable to your deeds: though (not to vndubbe you) howſoeuer the matter fall out, there will ſtill be left for you a title of Sir. Which title should ſeeme a little by your phraſe of ſpeaking, to bee the thing that made you engage your ſelfe in this quarrell, as if by the honour of your Knighthoode you thought your
<pb facs="tcp:2521:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſelfe bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therevnto: which if it were,<note place="margin">Sir Fr. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings. Sir Edw. Hobby. Sir Edw.

But ſeing, you will not be ware by other men's harmes, but be putting your fingar into the fire, you muſt take your chance as they did. And for triall of this quarrell you shall giue mee leaue to enter into the liſts with you in the examination of the booke it ſelf: heere only I shall a little examine what you ſay in your dedicatory Epiſtle.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In which, I reflect firſt, vpon the title, which is, <hi>to the religious and well affected Gentry of this Kingdome,</hi> what should be the cauſe, you should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate this your worke to the Gentry particularly, the thing yt ſelf pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning alike to all ſortes of men, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue ſoules to ſaue; vnleſſe it were that by hauing ſpecially to doe with Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you would faine ſeeme to haue ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mewhat of the Gentlemen. For which I blame you not, hauing need thereof: for ſetting your Knighthood a part, it may be your gentry may be queſtioned, yf it be true that I haue heard, of the
<pb facs="tcp:2521:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
honeſt Grocer your father, who dwelt next doore to the George in Kings ſtreete: by which your birth as it were by a natural kinde of congruity, you may ſeeme rather ordained to haue to doe with a peſtel and a morter, then a ſworde, or pen. This I doe not ſay Sir <hi>Humphrey,</hi> that a man meanely borne, may not by his deſerts come into a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ranke; for reaſon, authority, and example of all ſorts teach the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but becauſe, as nobility of extrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vertue ioyned together, adde and receiue luſtre reciprocally one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other; Soe meaneſſe of qualities or conditions, ſuch as you shew in your writings, and as (God willing) I shall out of them manifeſtly proue, doth more shew it ſelfe, being ioyned with a meane birth and education, the one as it were bearing witnes of the other. Wherefore mee thinkes Sir, you being priuy to your owne wants of this kind, should haue forborne to proclayme them to the world by this manner of writing; which euery man preſently ſeeth, cannot come from an ingenuous
<pb facs="tcp:2521:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
diſpoſition, ſuch as a Gentleman is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to haue.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But now to come to your Epiſtle it ſelf, you ſay you haue attempted to ſend forth this Eſſay of your poore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours, to make the world ſee, it is noe difficult matter for a meane Lay man, to proue the ancient Viſibility of the Proteſtant profeſſion; prouoked thereto by a Ieſuit's challenge, to shew out of good authors, that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant's church was viſible in all ages before <hi>Luther;</hi> and this you vndertake to doe, not onely out of the moſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox fathers, but alſoe out of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish <hi>Bishops. Doctours, Cardinals</hi> &amp;c. This eſſay of your labours Sir <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey,</hi> is poore indeede, not to ſtand complementinge with you, as I shall after shew: and for your proofes out of <hi>Fathers,</hi> and other writers in the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Church, wee shall there alſo ſee what ones, they are; that is, either no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe, or out of Authors branded with the marks of hereſy, or at leaſt temerity and ſingularity. For the challenge it ſelfe, wherein conſiſteth
<pb facs="tcp:2521:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the ſtate of the queſtion, I ſay heere, that you doe not ſett it downe ſoe true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully, as you should. For you were to shew the Viſibility of your Church, by naming ſome who in all ages did profeſſe the Proteſtant faith, as it is now taught, and profeſſed in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, entirely beleiuing all that is heere beleiued, and beleeuinge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els that is contrary vnto it. Which you might haue done, if it could be done, out of ſome good hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, without ſtanding vpon proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes of the particular points of doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, out of this or that author, for that was not to the preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Neither were it ſufficient, as you ſay in your next paragraphe, ſeeing it is confeſſed on all ſides, that the faith of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the firſt age had viſible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours, therefore to proue that the Faith of the Church of England is that, which was deliuered to the Saints by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> without farther recitall of ſucceeding witneſſes: this I ſay were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.
<pb facs="tcp:2521:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For the chalenge then which you were now to anſweare, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſy which you were to handle, was not ſoe much of the truth of this or that particular point, or of the doctrine euen in generall, but of the Church it ſelf, which was to deliuer the doctrine, and by which we were to come to the knowledge of the truth, who the men were, that were truſted to keepe the depoſitu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> gaue <hi>Timothy</hi> charge of, where the Church was, which the ſame S. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the howſe of God, the pillar and firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of truth? Which was the ſeede of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whereof <hi>I ſay</hi> prophecieth, and promiſeth in the perſon of <hi>God the Father,</hi> to his <hi>Sonne,</hi> that hee would neuer take away the words of truth from their mouth? <hi>Hoc foedus meum cum eis dicit Dominus. Spiritus meus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.21.</note> 
               <hi>qui est in te, &amp; verba mea, quae po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſui in ore tuo, non recedent de ore tuo, &amp; de ore ſeminis tui, &amp; de ore Seminis Seminis tui, dicit Dominus, amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do &amp; vſque in ſempiternum.</hi> This is my couenant with them ſaith our Lord.
<pb facs="tcp:2521:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
My ſpiritt that is in thee, and my words that I haue put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth, and out of the mouth of thy ſeede, and out of the mouth of thy Seed's ſeede ſaith our Lord from this preſent and for euer.

Soe as this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſy being of the <hi>Church</hi> it ſelf, which was to be found out, by the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and ſucceſſion thereof, not ſoe much by the doctrine, it could be no way ſufficient to proue that the doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of the Proteſtant church, was taught anciently: though that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee proued. For as I ſay the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not of the doctrine, but of the perſons: Wherein the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> tooke the right way, like a wiſe man and a good ſcholar, to find out the Doctrine, which is a thing more ſpirituall and leſſe ſubiect to the ſenſe, by that which

            <p n="8">8.

For Viſibility and antiquity are two different properties: antiquity properly belongeth to the doctrine and beleife of the Church; but Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility properly belongeth to the <hi>Church</hi> it ſelf, as it is a <hi>Church,</hi> to wit, a community, commonwealth, or kingdome conſiſting of men liuing in a certaine forme of gouernment, and
<pb facs="tcp:2521:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
profeſſing a certaine outward forme or face of Religion, by Sacrifice, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and other rites, tending to the worship of God and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of themſelues, wherein all that are of that Community doe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate, and thereby are diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and differenced from all ſuch as are not of the ſame Community and profeſſion. Wherefore you being cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged to shew ſuch a community, and flying from that to proue the antiquity of your Doctrine, out of our Fathers and Schoolmen, what els doe you doe, but confeſſe your <hi>Church</hi> to want <hi>Viſibility,</hi> and your ſelfe honeſty, by endeauouring to deceiue men with a ſpecious title <hi>of a ſafe way;</hi> intending indeed to lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de them, from the true ſafe way of the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> into ſuch cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine by-ways and corners, as our <hi>B.

<pb facs="tcp:2521:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you may perceiue, how vnfittly you ioyne, or rather confound antiquity and Viſibility, by ſaying in the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginninge of this your Epiſtle, <hi>the ancient viſibility of the Protestant profeſsion,</hi> and ſoe in many other places. For Viſibility muſt as well be <hi>new,</hi> to follow your manner of ſpeaking, as <hi>ancient:</hi> that is, it is a thing which hath beene without interruption, is, and euer muſt bee to the worlds end, <hi>in the true Church of God;</hi> and is noe more tyed to theſe primiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues or ancient tymes, then to theſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ours, nor noe more to thoſe ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of ours then to thoſe that shall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me after vs againe. Or if it more belong to one tyme then another, it rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth more to ſucceeding tymes. For as it is cleare by the Prophecies going before our B.

which tyme, it muſt needs be more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible then in the beginninge. Soe that little Stone,<note place="margin">

            <p n="9">9. But now you come vpon vs with a counter challenge, demanding by what authority of ſcriptures and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, we haue impoſed new articles of Chriſtian beleife vppon Preiſts and people: for, as you ſay, truth denyes antiquity and vniuerſality to the principal articles of the new Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Creede: and you ſay our beſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

<pb facs="tcp:2521:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for proofe of the Viſibility of your Church, as we did many of ours, as <hi>Sanders, Bellarmine, Gualterus,</hi> &amp; others. You aske by what authority we impoſe new articles of beleife vpon men? this queſtion is not to the purpoſe: but I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare, by denying your ſuppoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; for we doe not impoſe new articles vpon men, but defend the old, againſt new fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gled fellowes, neither is this the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place for you to require, or for vs to bring proofes out of Fathers &amp; Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of particular points; whereof you cannot but know, that many great and learned men in the Catholick Church, haue written great volumes; which noe haeretique hath euer yet durſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to anſweare, how then can you ſoe braſenly ſay, that our owne beſt learned confeſſe, that the articles of the <hi>Trent-Creede</hi> as you call them, are vnknowne to antiquity: what point is there defined in the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> which is not proued by way of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſcriptures &amp; fathers by <hi>Iudocus Coccius,</hi> by way of reaſon and ſolution of arguments by <hi>Bell.</hi> by way of hiſtory by <hi>Baronius,</hi> to ſay nothing of others?
<pb facs="tcp:2521:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſome may perhaps ſay, that ſome points there defined were not before defined by any general Councel; but to bring any Catholique to ſay that they are new or that they were not ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nor commonly beleeued I dare ſay Sir <hi>Humphrey,</hi> is more then you can proue: but ſuppoſe any one may ſay, that there is noe proofe extant in any ancient author of this or that point, muſt it therefore follow that it is new? noe ſurely, for all things are not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as <hi>S.

               <pb facs="tcp:2521:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it is pitty you are ſoe hard driuen, as when you are called vpon to proue your Succeſſion and Viſibility of your Church, to fall vpon vs for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: a thing of ſoe different nature and ſoe triuiall. For firſt it is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, that we leaue out that which you call the ſecond commandment, Looke in our bibles and ſee whether you find it not there in all Editions, and tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as well English as Latine, or any other language whatſoeuer. How then doe we leaue it out? you will ſay we leaue it out in our catechiſmes; true: but to leaue a thing out of a catechiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, is not abſolutely to leaue it out, as long as it is els where. But beſids to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare you another way, wee leaue out many other things, as that <hi>God is a iealous God, that hee reuengeth the Sinnes of the Father to the</hi> 3. <hi>and</hi> 4. <hi>generation</hi> and the like, though they goe intermingled with the commandements in the text: and this we doe without blame; becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe they eyther pertaine not preciſely to the commandement, or are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently expreſſed in the very words of
<pb facs="tcp:2521:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the commandement it ſelf. Soe wee ſay of this, that it is either contayned in the firſt commandement being one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an explication of the ſame; or if it be a diſtinct precept as ſome Deuines ſay, then is it ceremoniall onely, and conſequently abrogated with the whole Law.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Soe likewiſe for the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of Sanctifying the <hi>Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes</hi> I anſweare that in our bibles or text of ſcripture we keepe the word <hi>Sabboth,</hi> and in moſt and beſt cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſmes alſo, as for example <hi>Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, Bellarmines</hi> large catechiſme, and others but ſpecially in that of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> ſett out by authority of <hi>Pius V.</hi> Which were anſweare enough to shew we make noe ſuch myſtery of it, ſince ſometymes we ſay <hi>Sabboth</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes <hi>Holydayes:</hi> as indeede we well may, the ſenſe being the ſame: and we may better vſe this liberty in catechiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, where we ſtand not ſoe much to cite the very words of ſcripture, as to declare the meaning of them; though in the text it ſelfe we keepe preciſely to

But you ſay, they were not taught <hi>de fide</hi> as <hi>points of Faith;</hi> what is that to ſay? that they were neuer defined all in any general Councel, I grant you that; but what then? muſt they not therefore belong to <hi>Faith?</hi> how many points be there that were neuer ſoe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined?
<pb facs="tcp:2521:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will it not ſerue your turne, that they were commonly beleeued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction of any, as all theſe were? or if ſome one Doctour should bee ſingular in his opinion, yet ſoe as to be ready to ſubmit his iudgment to the definition of the church, what would this hinder? nay would it not much hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe to proue the continual Viſibility &amp; ſupereminent authority of the <hi>Church,</hi> which is the queſtion now betweene vs? but of this more afterwards. Now for our Doctours, whom you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to be miſtaken, in witneſſing the antiquity of your doctrine, I wil ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing heere, but in dew place wil shew how notoriouſly you falſifye ſome, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently alleadge others, and eyther very maliciouſly or very ignorantly bring condemned knowne Haeretiques againſt vs, for authors of our owne.</p>
            <p n="15">15. In which reguard I cannot but admire to heare you ſoe hypocritically to conclude your Epiſtle, ſaying that though by the prouocation of a <hi>Ieſuit,</hi> you haue putt your ſickle into another man's harueſt, yet you witneſſe a true

Whereas you offend in all kind of falshood. For euen where you happ to cite a place truely, for ſoe much as pertaineth to the words, you doe it ſoe cleane kam from the authors meaning, and diſcourſe, that euery man may ſee how euidently falſe, and conſequently how iniurious both to God and Man that profeſſion of yours is, wherein you call them to witneſſe your truth &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty in the citing of authors.</p>

if they be shewed you moderately, plainely, and faithfully: I muſt deale freely with you Sir <hi>Humphrey,</hi> and tell you, that indeede I take your weakneſſe or ignorance to be noe whit leſſe, if not more, then you ſeeme to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, both by what I find in this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, &amp; by what I heare from ſome that know you well, and verily thinke you ſcarſe skill euen of ordinary Latin much leſſe of ſuch other Learning as is needfull for writing books of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

            <p n="1">1. WHereas <hi>Sir Humphrey</hi> after his dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Epiſtle, before he come to the matter, ſetteth downe a part of <hi>Pius</hi> 4. his bull, which is of the forme of oath, and profeſſion of faith, which according to the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> ſuch men are to make, as are to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to any Eccleſiaſtical dignity or benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, which hath care of ſoules ioyned with it. I purpoſe likewiſe in this Chapter by occaſion hereof, to ſett downe ſome few heades, which may ſerue for a generall anſweare to moſt of his arguments.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The firſt shalbe concerning this very <hi>Creede</hi> as he calleth it of the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> which therefore he is pleaſed according to the common fashion of his Miniſters, by way of deriſion to deuide into 12. points, as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 12. articles, which he and they might with as much reaſon deuide into 24. but onely that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2521:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by this fine conceite, they would faine make ſome ſilly people beleiue, that wee <hi>Catholiques</hi> leaue the <hi>old Creede</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and coyne our ſelues a new one, according to the <hi>faith of the Councel of Trent,</hi> and this hee and his freinds doe often charge vs with. To which I ſay, that True it is wee confeſſe it, the points in this forme contained were defined and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by that <hi>Councel,</hi> and drawne into forme of an oath and profeſſion of faith, by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> 4. but that it is therefore a new <hi>Faith,</hi> or that there bee new articles of beleife wee deny. For proofe whereof I demaund of him or his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, who receiue the <hi>Nicene Creede,</hi> as it is ſett downe in their booke of common prayer, what they thinke of that? whether that be any thing els but a profeſſion of faith, ſett downe by authority of the Church, gathered together in a generall Councell, approued by the <hi>See Apoſtolique,</hi> by way of a definition or explication of a point of faith then contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted by Haeretiques, and diſcuſſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the Councel, and appointed to bee publiquely profeſſed by all ſuch as meant to bee counted <hi>Catholiques<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Wherein I would far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know of him what other difference there is, but onely that the <hi>Creede</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> was made, for declaration of the <hi>Catholique faith</hi> in the point of the <hi>Diuinity</hi> of <hi>our Sauiour;</hi> and this of the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> for declaration of all theſe points controuerted by the Haeretiques of theſe tymes. And yet in one thing more they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2521:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
agree, that is, that as the <hi>Arrians</hi> of thoſe ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes cried out againſt that <hi>Creede,</hi> as being new, and hauing words not found in Scripture, for example <hi>Conſubſtantiation:</hi> Soe our <hi>Proteſtants</hi> cry out againſt the <hi>Trent</hi> profeſſion of <hi>Faith,</hi> for the ſame reaſons of nouelty, and words not found in ſcripture, as for example <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. But to come neerer vnto them. They allow of the <hi>Nicene Creede;</hi> they will not then I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſay, the <hi>Faith</hi> therein taught eyther now is, or then was <hi>new,</hi> though it were then firſt declared by authority of any <hi>Councel.</hi> Which if they doe not, as indeede they cannot; then ſay I in like ſort, the profeſſion of <hi>Faith</hi> ſett downe by the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> and Pope <hi>Pius</hi> 4. is noe <hi>new Faith,</hi> but the <hi>old Faith</hi> of late particularly declared, and defined againſt the haereſies of theſe tymes. I could alſo in proofe of the ſame, vrge <hi>Sir Humphrey,</hi> with the 39. articles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the authority of the <hi>Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> to bee vniformely taught by all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and which they are to ſweare vnto. Which articles, though they be indeede new coyned, as the foundation of a new Church: Yet <hi>Sir Humphrey</hi> being his Mother's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, will not I ſuppoſe yeild her or her doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to be new: as yet on the other ſide he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny, but thoſe articles receiued ſome kind of force, whereby <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were more bound to beleiue and teach them then before. From whence I might euidently inferre, that a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2521:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
new definition or declaration, doth not make the <hi>Doctrine new;</hi> but that ancient doctrine may be newly defined according as new ſpringing hereſies shall giue occaſion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Which being ſoe, it is plaine that all his inſulting ſpeeches againſt the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Catholique church</hi> are but verie ſmoke, and may bee as eaſily blowne backe vpon <hi>Himſelfe</hi> and <hi>his church:</hi> and that by them hee doth but furnish vs with weapons againſt himſelf, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein alſo bewraying his ignorance. For whoſe better inſtruction, if hee be not too wiſe to learne, hee is to know two things in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Firſt, that we <hi>Catholiques</hi> doe not call all points of faith howſoeuer taught, declared or defined <hi>articles</hi> as hee ſeemeth to thinke, and the ground of this his errour may bee; in that thoſe great maine points of his Churches doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, called the 39. articles are called by that name of <hi>articles.</hi> But wee call that onely an <hi>article,</hi>

               </note> according to S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> which contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſome ſpeciall reaſon of difficulty in it ſelf; whereby it requireth a particular and diſtinct reuelacion, becauſe it cannot bee inferred or deduced out of any other reuealed truth: as for example, the point of our <hi>Sauiour's reſurrection,</hi> is cleane a different point from that point of <hi>his death</hi> and <hi>paſsion,</hi> and this againe from that other of <hi>his Natiuity,</hi> and ſoe of the reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe each of them requireth a diſtinct and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall reuelacion from the other. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> might haue beene borne, and yet not dye vpon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2521:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the croſſe; and hee might haue died, and yet not riſen the third day from death to life: but thoſe other truthes defined by the <hi>Church,</hi> as the <hi>vnity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's perſon</hi> againſt <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> the <hi>diſtinction of his two natures</hi> againſt <hi>Sergius, Pir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus &amp;c.</hi> are not to bee called <hi>articles,</hi> becauſe they are ſufficiently contained in others, and deduced out of them. Other Diuines giue other definitions of an <hi>article</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> which may alſo well ſtand with this of S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> which I follow as the more common, but all agree in this, that though euery article bee a propoſition of <hi>Faith,</hi> yet euerie propoſition is not an <hi>article</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. And heerevpon we teach, that for <hi>articles</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> can make none, as <hi>she</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not write a canonical booke of ſcripture, but that belongeth onely to the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> or rather hath beene fully and perfectly performed by them to whom thoſe articles were immediately reuealed by God, whereof they deliuered part by writing and part by word of mouth to their poſterity <hi>the Church.</hi> Soe as now there neede not any new and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reuelacions, but out of thoſe already made to the Apoſtles and <hi>Prophets,</hi> which are all laid vpp in the <hi>treaſury</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> as a <hi>pawne or depoſitum</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it, other truths are drawne the <hi>holy Church</hi> and <hi>true ſpouſe of Chriſt</hi> euer keeping this pretious treaſure with continuall care and vigilancie, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing the ſame faithfully to her Children, as

From which followeth; that other thing, which I mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to tell the <hi>Knight</hi> for his learning, which alſo I touched before in a word, to wit, that when points of doctrine before in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſy and vndefined, come to bee defined by the <hi>Church,</hi> the doctrine is not therefore new, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is <hi>de fide,</hi> or <hi>matter of faith</hi> now, which it was not before, as he moſt falſely and fondly ſuppoſeth for an vndoubted truth; and vpon this his owne idle fancy, buildeth many goodly arguments, like ſoe many caſtles in the ayre.

forbidden in the <hi>index librorum prohibitorum?</hi> the table of forbidden bookes. Wherein I cannot but note Sir <hi>Humphrey's</hi> ill fauoured and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt dealing in pretending to cite only our owne <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Schoolemen,</hi> and yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards obtruding ſuch as he knoweth to bee ſubiect to ſoe mayne exception and ſoe to bee by vs diſauowed and reiected as incompetent Iudges or witneſſes.</p>

For it is nothing but a continuance of the ſame care which hath beene euer obſerued in the Church of God for preſeruing of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique fayth and integrity of life from the corruption of Haeretiques, and other wicked men, who by bookes bring great preiudice both to <hi>Faith</hi> and manners, vnleſſe ſpecial care be vſed for praeuenting thereof. Of the neceſſity and iuſtnes of which courſe the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re be whole books written by diuers learned <hi>Catholique Doctors,</hi> neyther can any body diſlike thereof, but onely Haeretiques; who indeede find themſelues mightily aggreiued therewith as being by this courſe depriued of a chiefe meanes of ſpreading their wicked doctrine by

            <p n="18">18. But becauſe Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> will needs haue it that the <hi>bible</hi> is alſo forbidden and the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's writings</hi> appointed to bee corrected and raſed. I anſweare that for the <hi>Bible</hi> indeede it is not permitted in the vulgar language to euery body without any reguard or diſtinction of perſons, as it neuer was nor ought to bee, as is well proued by authority of <hi>Fathers</hi> and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the preface of the <hi>Rhemes teſtament.</hi> But yet it is not ſoe forbidden, but that it is in the <hi>Bishop's</hi> power to grant leaue, if vpon conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce with the <hi>Parish-Prieſt</hi> or <hi>Confeſſor</hi> of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that deſireth leaue, hee find him to bee ſuch an one, as may not incurre danger of faith, but be like to increaſe in vertue and deuotion by reading thereof.

What is it then that theſe men would haue? what is it they can carpe at? no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that they themſelues are ſtunge in that, heereby they are kept either from publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing their owne wicked works, or corrupting the <hi>Fathers</hi> at their pleaſure: and to wipe away this blemish from themſelues they would lay it vpon vs. And by this that is heere ſaid of this matter may be anſweared noe little part of Sir <hi>Humphrey's</hi> booke, whereof one whole chapter is of this matter, beſide other bitter inuectiues vpon other occaſions to fill his paper: though there alſo I shall haue occaſion to ſay ſomewhat more heereof.</p>
            <p n="19">19. The laſt thing which heere I meane to ſpeake of is a certaine diſtinction of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite</hi> and <hi>implicite faith</hi> wich the <hi>Knight</hi> and his Miniſters cry out againſt and are pleaſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes to make themſelues merry withall

as if they would laugh it out: but it is too well and ſolidly grounded to be blowne away with the breath of any ſuch Miniſterial <hi>Knight</hi> as he is. I will therefore only declare it in a word that the Reader may ſee whether the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or the <hi>Knight</hi> bee more worthy to be laughed at. The words <hi>explicite</hi> and <hi>implicite</hi> are drawne from the Latine and they ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie as much as <hi>foulded,</hi> and <hi>vnfoulded,</hi> or <hi>wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vpp and layd open.</hi> And <hi>explicite faith</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth a beleefe directly and expreſly beleeuing a particular point of <hi>faith</hi> in it ſelf not as it is inuolued or wrapped vpp in an other; <hi>impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite faith</hi> is the beleefe of any point of <hi>faith,</hi> not in it ſelf but in ſome other general prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple wherein it lyeth inuolued, or as it we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re wrapped vpp; as <hi>Catholiques</hi> beleeue in many thingh as the <hi>Church</hi> beleeueth though they doe not know what the <hi>Church</hi> holdeth particularly in this or that point. Now all <hi>Catholiques</hi> being bound to the <hi>beleefe</hi> of the <hi>Catholique faith</hi> wholy and entirely vnder paine of damnation, as ſaith Saint <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> in his <hi>Crede;</hi> and all not being able to know what is taught in euery particular, there muſt be ſome meanes whereby to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiue all, and this by an <hi>implicite faith</hi> inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in it ſelf a promptnes or readines of the <hi>vnderſtanding</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> to obey and rely vpon the authority of the <hi>holy Church;</hi> wherein noe <hi>Catholique</hi> that beleeueth any one point

            <p n="20">20. Neither is this <hi>implicite faith</hi> for the ignorant alone as the <hi>Knight</hi> ſaith but it is for all both learned and vnlearned; for there is noe man ſoe learned but may be ignorant of ſome one point or other; or at leaſt in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not yet defined, he muſt haue that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency and readines of Will and iudgment to beleeue as the <hi>Church</hi> shall teach. True it is the vnlearned know leſſe of particular points though all be bound to the <hi>expreſſe</hi> or <hi>explicite</hi> knowledge of ſome <hi>articles</hi> as of the <hi>Apoſtles Creede,</hi> of the <hi>Commaundements</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Church, Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> of ſome <hi>Sacrements,</hi> and euery one of ſoe much as perteyneth both to the common obligation of Chriſtian Dewty and of his owne parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſtate and vocation. For the reſt it is not neceſſary for any one in particular to know all, but it ſufficeth that he haue a minde ſoe praepared that when he shall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand more to be needfull he be ready to embrace it, Which a man would thinke we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re but reaſon. And for this diſpoſition and praeparation of minde wherein the eſſence of <hi>implicite faith</hi> conſiſteth it is alike both in the learned and vnlearned. The want whereof in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2521:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Proteſtants</hi> is the very reaſon why they haue noe true <hi>faith</hi> at all euen in the <hi>beleefe</hi> of thoſe myſteries which they beleeue: for by this it plainely appeareth, that euen in thoſe things which they beleeue they haue noe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard to any authority by which they are propounded vnto them, but onely becauſe they thinke good themſelues and although they should beleeue all things which <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques</hi> beleeue but not for the reaſon which they beleeue but becauſe they pleaſe themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues yet were not this <hi>faith,</hi> and ſoe it is much better to beleeue a few things <hi>expreſly</hi> with a reſolution to beleeue whatſoeuer els shalbe propounded by the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> then to beleeue a great many more with out this minde. For that former is <hi>diuine faith,</hi> this later onely <hi>humane ſelfe opinion</hi> and <hi>iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="21">21. Neither is there any cauſe why this <hi>Knight</hi> should ſoe cry out againſt <hi>implicite faith</hi> obtruded (as he ſaith) vpon the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; for it is not obtruded vpon any man, but rather we deſire with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> that <hi>all may bee replenished which the Knowledge of God and heauenly things:</hi> but euery bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy knoweth that all men are not of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity and vnderſtanding alike.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2521:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to beleeue as others in the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> beleeue. Doth not S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeake, <hi>Wiſedome among the perfect</hi> that is, teach them the greater and higher myſteries of <hi>faith,</hi> and yet to others <hi>hee giues onely milke,</hi>

By this any man may ſee whether this diſtinction of <hi>explicite</hi> and <hi>implicite faith</hi> doe not ſtand with very great reaſon and conſequently whether the <hi>Knight</hi> who laugheth thereat doe not shew himſelf moſt worthy of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</p>

That all this is without cauſe he proueth, firſt by an authority of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> which ſpeakes of a contention betweene two factions in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and the reaſon to allay it, becauſe (ſaith <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi>) both parts make one and the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion

of their faith, for both maintaine the <hi>Creede</hi> of the <hi>Nicene Councel.</hi> Secondly by the authority of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> whom hee maketh to ſay, <hi>that the Apoſtles neuer propounded as common articles of faith, other things then the articles of the Apoſtles Creede, the ten commandements, and ſome few of the Sacraments: becauſe theſe things are ſimply neceſſary and profitable for all men, the reſt are ſuch as a man may bee ſaued without them.</hi> Thirdly he maketh it an vndeniable truth that the <hi>refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church</hi> and the <hi>Romane</hi> are two Siſters; and that the <hi>Romane Church</hi> fayling, and beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming an Harlott: it was well done of his <hi>Church</hi> to ſeperate her ſelf, leaſt <hi>she</hi> might bee partaker of her plagues.

               <hi>It is to bee noted firſt, that in the Chriſtian Doctrine, as well of faith as manners, there bee ſome things ſimply neceſſary to Saluation for all men; as the knowledge of the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Apoſtles Creede, the ten Commandments, and ſome Sacraments.

Firſt by asking what all this is to his purpoſe, ſuppoſe it were true? Doth this shew his <hi>Church</hi> to haue beene alwayes viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or ours to haue beene at any tyme not viſible. Hee was not to ſtand vpon matter of contention, who was cauſe or not cauſe the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof, or who would haue mended, who not. For the errors in <hi>faith,</hi> which hee ſeemeth to tax <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s with-all in his third ſection: if he can proue them, he ſaith ſomewhat indeede; though yet not ſoe fully to his purpoſe. For though hee proue vs to haue had ſome er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours it doth not ſoe preſently follow that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2521:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they of his ſide haue had none; or that the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore their <hi>Church</hi> hath beene euer viſible there is a great deale more required to it then ſoe. And though he should proue ſome er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors to haue beene taught by ſome particular men, or euen in ſome Country profeſſing the <hi>Catholique faith,</hi> it doth not follow that the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> hath fayled in <hi>faith,</hi> or ceaſed to bee viſible.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly I anſweare to his ſecond Section, which is to proue that the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proceeded from vs, which hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh to proue by our owne confeſſion: that in all this Section, he bringeth but fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re authorities to wit. <hi>Caſſander,</hi> a <hi>Canon</hi> of his <hi>English Church</hi> out of the praeface to <hi>Iewels works; Camden</hi> citing <hi>S. Bede, Pleſsy Morney</hi> citing <hi>Michael Caeſenas.</hi> Of all which onely <hi>S. Bede</hi> is a <hi>Catholique,</hi> and euen ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>Proteſtant Camden,</hi> and onely for a ſtory which he tels of one <hi>Redwalde king</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt Saxons,</hi> who being firſt conuerted to Chriſtianity, and after ſeduced by his wife had in the ſame Church, two altars, one for <hi>Chriſt's</hi> religion, another for the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels</hi> out of which this <hi>knight</hi> frameth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a pretty fancy, being deſirous heereby to make men beleiue, that the like happened in the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> and that ſome ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red God onely, others fell to adore Saints and images, and the like. Which fond conceit what anſweare can it deſerue?
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2521:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For it is but the bare ſaying of one that doth not vnderſtand what he ſaith. For otherwiſe how could he poſſibly ſay ſuch a thing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without ſaying when, where, or how that happed, to vs; or euer ſaying word in proofe that the caſe is the ſame. I might with as much reaſon out of this ſtory of <hi>Redwalde</hi> ſay as much of <hi>Sir Humphrey Linde</hi> that hee and his <hi>Proteſtants</hi> haue built a new <hi>Church,</hi> a new <hi>faith,</hi> erected an altar againſt an altar, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But as I was ſaying of his authors, they are not many as you ſee, much leſſe haue they any part among <hi>Catholiques.</hi> For <hi>Caſſander, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael de Caeſenas,</hi> and <hi>Philip Morney,</hi> are in the <hi>Index of forbidden books. Camden</hi> and his <hi>Engliſh Canon writers</hi> are <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> but, which is more ſtrange, not a man of theſe ſuch as they are, that ſaith any thing of that which hee preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the title of his Chapter, but onely <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander;</hi> who after the fashion of <hi>Haretiques,</hi> ſpeaketh of the Pompe and pride of the Clergy, and that they will not hearken to the admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſome godly men aduiſing reformation: theſe godly men he meaneth, ſuch as himſelf, that is <hi>Haeretiques</hi> or next doore to them, though <hi>Sir Humphrey</hi> pleaſe often to call him a <hi>Learned Romaniſt.</hi> Soe that all the cauſe that euen this man alleageth of the contention is, becauſe the <hi>eccleſiaſtical perſons will not yeild themſelues to Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques,</hi> and lett them haue the ordering and diſpoſing of all things at their pleaſures; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they breake away and fall into contention
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2521:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with the Church. What cauſe doe Clergy men giue of contention? in not ſubmitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to their inferiours, and to men that haue noe authority ouer them: or euen if the counſel of theſe people were good as it is not and that Clergy men thinke not good to follow it, muſt they therefore preſently fall to ſchiſme and haereſy, tearing and renting the <hi>Church.</hi> By what Law are Clergy men bound to obey ſuch fellowes? if in a ciuill commonwealth, ſome great man should diſlike the gouernment, eyther becauſe his enemyes haue the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of matters, or that he thimketh he could doe it better then they, and preſuming to giue counſell to the Prince and his counſel, they shoull not follow it, and that therefore hee should goe from court make head and raiſe a rebellion in the common wealth; who should bee counted cauſe of this contention? the Prince and his Counſel or hee? if Sir <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> be iudge, he muſt ſay, the Prince and his Counſel, if he will make good his man <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander's</hi> diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As for <hi>Michael de Caeſena</hi> whom the <hi>Knight</hi> alſo calleth a <hi>learned Friar,</hi> it is true he was a Friar and General of his <hi>Order,</hi> but for his learning I neuer heard any ſuch commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: but we know why the <hi>Knight</hi> prayſeth him: Well be it ſoe; but the man being excommunicated and depoſed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> for his diſobedience and rebellion, he ſaid that particular man, which was <hi>Iohn</hi> 22.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2521:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was an <hi>Apoſtata,</hi> and an <hi>Heretique:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noe <hi>true Pope.</hi> But that he made two ſuch <hi>Churches,</hi> one of the wicked vnder the <hi>Pope,</hi> another of the good without any heade as <hi>Morney</hi> makes him make, and this <hi>Knight</hi> out of him, I find not in any, good author, but rather that hee allowed of the authority of the <hi>Romane Church;</hi> for he appealed from the <hi>Popes</hi> ſentence to it; as may be ſeene in <hi>Coquus</hi> his anſweare to <hi>Morney's myſtery of iniquity pag.</hi> 205. <hi>to.</hi> 2. and in the table <hi>verbo Michael de Coeſena.</hi> Neither was he euer taxed with any ſuch <hi>haereſy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. His <hi>English Church-Canon</hi> commandeth nothing to be taught as matter of faith, but what is agreable to the <hi>Old and new teſtament,</hi> and is collected out of the <hi>ancient Fathers</hi> and <hi>Catholique Bishops</hi> but what is that to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? how doth this proue vs to giue the cauſe of Contention? hee will ſay, this proueth his men to giue none. I anſweare that if all the reſt of their <hi>Canons</hi> and proceedings were anſwearable to the ſaying of this <hi>Canon,</hi> there would perhaps bee ſomewhat leſſe to doe. Though it be not any way conformable to the Scripture and doctrine of <hi>fathers</hi> for lay autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to make <hi>Canons</hi> for Clergy men: and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore the practiſe shewed in this <hi>Canon</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the words. And ſoe the 2. ſection is anſweared.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The third ſection is of corruptions both
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2521:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in <hi>faith</hi> and manners which the <hi>Knight</hi> ſaith we confeſſe and yet deny to reforme. He proueth it out of the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Piſa</hi> where <hi>Alexander the</hi> 5.<note place="margin">Concil Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan. ſeſſ. <hi>20.</hi>
               </note> promiſed to attend to the reformacion of the <hi>Church</hi> and out of the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> acknowledging many things amiſſe in matter of <hi>indulgences, Maſſe &amp;c.</hi> To this I anſweare that for matter of manners we willingly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge reformacion to be needfull: and ſuch it is that theſe <hi>two Councels</hi> ſpeake of, and haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed as is to beſeene by their Decrees: though the former be not of any great authority.<note place="margin">Concil. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. ſeſs. <hi>22.</hi> Decret. de reformat.</note> And for the later, it complaineth indeede with great reaſon of the auarice of ſuch as had the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of moneys giuen in almes by occaſion of indulgences. Whom the <hi>Knight</hi> calleth the <hi>Popes</hi> Collectors though the <hi>Councel</hi> ſpeake not of the <hi>Pope.</hi> But he out of his loue to the <hi>Pope</hi> would faine bring him in vpon al ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. This is true: but falſe it is, which he ſaith: that the <hi>Councel</hi> complaineth of <hi>indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences</hi> an article of the <hi>Romane faith</hi> as his words are. For as it reformeth the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the officers, ſoe doth it eſtablish the truth of the Doctrine, as appeareth by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular decree thereof which is alſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and cited els where by this <hi>Knight</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf whereby hee is conuinced of wilfull cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. The ſame <hi>Councel</hi> likewiſe complaineth of many things crept in, in the celebration of Maſſe by the fault of the tymes, or careleſneſſe and wickedneſſe of men which are farre from
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2521:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the dignity of ſoe great a ſacrifice. The words of the <hi>Councel</hi> are right cited by him in Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in the margent, perhaps to ſaue his credit by ſincerity ſoe much promiſed in his Epiſtle dedicatory but in the English, which goeth in the text he fouly corrupteth them they are thus in Latine. <hi>Cum multa irrepſiſſe videantur.</hi> Which in English is this. Seing many things ſeeme to haue crept in: which the <hi>Knight</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth thus, there were many errors and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions crept in to the Maſſe: which is a groſſe error and corruption in the <hi>Knight</hi> the <hi>Councel</hi> ſpeaking onely of abuſes which were crept in not of errours in matter of <hi>faith.</hi> The <hi>Councel</hi> likewiſe ſeemeth to acknowledge the auarice of <hi>Prieſts</hi> making ſuch bargaines for the ſaying of Maſſe as was not far from <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> or at leaſt filthy lucre. It ſpeaketh of the vſe of muſique where with ſome wantoneſſe was mixed as alſoe of certaine Maſſes or cand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les vſed in certaine number, that number pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding rather from ſuperſtition then true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion this is true ſoe farre.</p>
            <p n="7">7. But that is not true, which the <hi>Knight</hi> ſaith, that we deny a reformation of theſe things for to what other end are they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted there, but to be reformed nay they are not named, but by way of forbidding them, and by way of commanding <hi>Bishops</hi> to refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſuch things euen as <hi>delegats</hi> of <hi>the ſee Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolique,</hi> where there is neede. Which is ſoe apparent, that the <hi>Knight</hi> is faine to confeſſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2521:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it after in theſe words. Neither did theſe men ſeeke reformation in manners onely, but in the doctrine it ſelfe. Wherein together with the contradiction of his owne former lye <hi>he</hi> telleth a new one, to wit in ſaying that we ſeeke a reformation in the doctrine whereof he nameth ſome particular points as <hi>priuate Maſſe, Latine ſeruice</hi> &amp;c. Which is moſt falſe for the doctrine, is the ſame ſtill, and euer was, that though the fruite were greater when the people did communicate with the <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſacramentally, yet the Maſſe in that caſe is neither vnlawfull, not is to be called priuate: both becauſe the people communicate ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, and alſo becauſe the Maſſe is offered by the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> as the publique Miniſter of the <hi>Church.</hi> It wisheth indeede, that the ſtanders by did communicate not onely ſpiritually, but alſoe ſacramentally: without euer mentioning the reformed or rather deformed <hi>Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. What error then doth the <hi>Councel</hi> hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re acknowledge? Againe the <hi>knight</hi> ſaith that though the <hi>Councel</hi> doe not allow the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Maſſe in the vulgar tongue, yet it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth <hi>Paſtors</hi> and others that haue care of ſoules, to explicate and expound to the people ſome of thoſe things that are reade in the Maſſe: and asketh thus, <hi>how neere theſe men doe come to our doctrine, who doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue!</hi> I anſweare that doe not I <hi>Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey,</hi> nor I thinke any man els. That hath ordinary, common ſenſe. You condemne all
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2521:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Maſſe.</hi> The <hi>Councel</hi> alloweth it: you condemne <hi>priuate Maſſe.</hi> The <hi>Councel</hi> approueth that which you call <hi>priuate Maſſe,</hi> but denieth that it is ſoe called <hi>Priuate</hi> as you would haue it. The <hi>Councel</hi> ſpeaketh of <hi>Maſſe</hi> the true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Sacrifice of the <hi>new Law:</hi> you would make men beleeue it ſpeaketh of your ſacrilegious Supper. In our <hi>Maſſe</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> as the <hi>Councel</hi> teacheth is offered and diſtributed the true, real and ſubſtantiall. <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Bloude</hi> of CHRIST IESVS and what it ſaith hereof you moſt madly would make me beleeue were ſpoken of your empty and imaginary commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. The <hi>Councel</hi> teacheth that the <hi>Maſſe</hi> is not generally to bee celebrated in the vulgar ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue: you would all publique prayer ſoe made: and therefore condemne the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> for celebrating in Latine which the <hi>Councel</hi> allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth. O madnes of a man then! to talke thus as if the <hi>Councel</hi> came neere to him when it ſaith yea to his <hi>nay,</hi> and <hi>nay</hi> to his <hi>yea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. But hauing thus ſubſtantially proued the <hi>Councel,</hi> to agree with him and finding other places of the ſame ſoe euidently againſt him hee will needs haue the <hi>Councel</hi> contradict it ſelf and for that end bringeth certaine contradictions as he wiſely taketh them to be: One is that the <hi>Pope</hi> in his <hi>Bull of profeſsion of faith,</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the vſe of Indulgences is moſt wholeſome for the people.</hi> For which hee might haue cited alſo the <hi>Councel</hi> more thou once; and that yet the <hi>Councel</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed the ſcandal that came by them was very great,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2521:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with out hope of reformacion: which is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction betweene the <hi>Councel</hi> and <hi>Pope</hi> but a flatt corruption of the <hi>Knights:</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> ſpeaking of one thing, to wit, <hi>Indulgences</hi> in themſelues: the <hi>Councel</hi> in this place ſpeaking of the men, that had the promulgacion of them, and the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of the almes. For preuenting whoſe auarice &amp; abuſes, there had bene ſoe many reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies vſed formerly in other <hi>Councels,</hi> but to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne effect, that this <hi>Councel</hi> thought good, to take that office wholy out of ſuch mens hands, and take another courſe with it. What ſeeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction is heere? Another of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradiction is, that the <hi>Councel</hi> approueth thoſe Maſſes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein the people doe not communicate, and yet wisheth that the people were ſoe deuoute as to communicate ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tally. Is not heere a ſtout co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradiction: as alſo that the <hi>Councel</hi> approueth Maſſe in an vn knowne to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue, and yet will haue the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> eſpecially vpon Sundayes and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, to declare ſome of that which is read, or ſome myſtery of the holy Maſſe? Doe not theſe two agree very well, I doe not ſee what the Man meaneth.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And to conclude this wiſe ſection, he talketh ſomewhat of reformacion hindered by ſome principall men as one <hi>Nicolas Scomberg</hi> a <hi>Dominican Cardinal.</hi> Citing fowre or fiue moſt haeretical books namely forbidden in the <hi>Romane Index</hi> (and among them the <hi>hiſtory of the Councel of Trent</hi> not named in the <hi>Index,</hi> becauſe it came out ſince, but written by an

make an end of this chapter, wherein I haue diſproued the <hi>Knight,</hi> and conuinced him of manifeſt falshood in both the things by him pretended, shewing in the one that the <hi>Councel</hi> acknowledged not any corruption in <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> but onely by <hi>Haeretiques:</hi> and in the other, that for corruption of manners which it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it hath vſed all poſſible meanes to redreſſe them.</p>

forbidding of Marriage generally to all ſorts, as a thing euill in it ſelf and vnlawfull, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding marriage in one particular ſtate or profeſſion, to which noe man is bound, but is left free whither he will embrace it with this condition or not.

an vnknowne tongue, wherein it is to bee wondered ſaith <hi>Eraſmus</hi> as the <hi>Knight</hi> citeth him, how the <hi>Church</hi> is altered. But <hi>Eraſmus</hi> is noe author for vs to anſweare: he is branded in the <hi>Romane Index.</hi> Neither neede I ſay more of the matter it ſelf in this place. A third error of ours as he pretendeth, is Communion in one kinde, for which he citeth <hi>Val.</hi> twice; once ſaying it is not knowne when it firſt gott footing in the <hi>Church;</hi> another tyme, that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in one kinde began to be generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, but a little before the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi> Which I ſee not to what purpoſe they are, if they were right cited, as the former is not.

Beſides for a final anſweare I ſay it is noe matter of doctrine, but practice, the doctrine hauing euer beene and being ſtill the ſame of the lawfulnes of one or both kinds as the <hi>Church</hi> shall ordaine, though vpon good reaſons the practize haue changed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

to the diuerſity and neceſſity of tyme. With all therefore that euer he can doe, he can not refute that argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which wee make againſt him and his, that our doctrine is not to be taxed of errour, ſoe long as they cannot shew, when, where, and by whom it beganne: as wee can and doe euery day of them and their doctrine.</p>
            <p n="11">11. But becauſe it is ordinary with theſe men to charge vs with this ſame ſecret <hi>apoſtacy</hi> and <hi>defection,</hi> though they cannot tell when nor how it hath come, I shall heere put this <hi>Knight</hi> in mind of two conuincing arguments to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, brought by <hi>the Catholique Diuine</hi> that anſweared that part of my Lo:<note place="margin">Anſw. to Cooks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports. ep. dedicat n. <hi>22.</hi> &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Cooke's reports</hi> before cited by this <hi>knight,</hi> to conuince the folly and vanity of a certaine ſimilitude of a wedge of gold, that was diſſolued and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with other mettals braſſe tinne &amp;c brought by <hi>Sir Edward</hi> to proue the diſſolution of the <hi>Romane Church</hi> by errors and innouatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, iuſt as this <hi>knight</hi> talketh. One of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is theological; the other moral. The firſt, that if the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> was the true mother Church, which both my <hi>Lord Cooke, our Knight,</hi> and all the reſt of them confeſſe, then were all the predictions &amp; promiſes of the <hi>Prophets</hi> for the greatnes, eminency, honour, certainty, and flourishing perpetuity of the ſaid <hi>Church</hi> fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in her; and <hi>Chriſt's</hi> peculiar promiſes in like manner: that hee would bee to the worlds end with her that hell gates should neuer preuaile

againſt her &amp;c. Were alſo performed in her, for ſoe many hundred yeares, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe her to haue continued in her purity; Whereof enſueth that either <hi>God</hi> is not able to performe his promiſe, or els it cannot be conceiued without impiety, that this flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing kingdome and Queene of the world should bee ſoe diſſolued and mingled with braſſe, tinne, copper, should bee ſoe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with errors and innouations, as to fall away by <hi>Apoſtacy;</hi> this is the theological argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which may bee read there more at large.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The moral is, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hauing purchaſed his <hi>Church</hi> at ſoe deare a rate as was the shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his bloud, and hauing ſett ouer it ſoe many <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> to keepe continuall watch, how is it poſſible that it should fall away and decay, without any one of all theſe watchmens once opening his mouth, to reſiſt or teſtify this chaunge.

            <p n="13">13. But not to detaine my ſelfe longer in it, I will heere onely repreſent a conſideration of <hi>Tertullian's</hi> ſuppoſing that this ſoe impoſſible a thing should happen. Goe too, ſaith hee, be it ſoe; let all haue erred,<note place="margin">praeſcr. cap. <hi>28.</hi>

ſent by <hi>Chriſt</hi> for this end, and deſired of the <hi>Father</hi> to be the <hi>teacher of truth;</hi> be it ſoe that the Steward of God, the Vicar of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> hath neglected his charge, ſuffering the Churches to vnderſtand otherwiſe, to beleeue otherwiſe then hee (that is <hi>Chriſt</hi>) preached by his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles;</hi> What, is it likely, that ſoe many and ſoe great should erre all in one beleefe? among many ſeuerall eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts there is not one iſſue. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke heere, one Steward of God's houshold, one Vicar of Chriſt to whoſe office it belongeth, to ſee that particular churches doe not teach nor beleeue otherwiſe then they were taught by the preaching of the Apoſtles. The error of doctrine of the <hi>Churches</hi> muſt haue beene ſeuerall, but that which is found one and the ſame among or with many, is not error but a thing deliuered, therefore may any man dare to ſay, that they who deliuered it did erre?

            </head>
            <p n="1">1. IN this Section <hi>Sir Humphrey</hi> you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a great taske, which if you performe according as you promiſe, <hi>eris mihi magnus Apollo</hi> If you doe not, then a man may ſay to you with out offence, <hi>magnus es ardelis.</hi> You vndertake to deriue vs by Succeſſion in perſon and doctrine from ancient <hi>Heretiques,</hi> and your ſelf from the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Which how truely you haue performed. I am in this chapter to exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. You beginne with <hi>Latine Seruice</hi> and <hi>Prayer in a ſtrange tongue,</hi> which you ſay out of one <hi>Wolphius</hi> a Lutheran Heretique, came into the <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>Pope Vitalian</hi> about the yeare 666. whereof you make a myſtery noting thus in the margent <hi>numerus beſtiae Apoc.</hi> 13. <hi>The number of the beaſt.</hi> From him you skippe to the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques <hi>Oſſeni,</hi> who taught as you ſay out of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2521:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that <hi>there was noe neede to make a prayer in a knowne tongue.</hi> From them you goe yet higher to the <hi>Apoſtle's</hi> tyme, wherein you ſay out of S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> that there were certaine <hi>Iewes</hi> among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> as namely the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who did celebrate the <hi>diuine Seruice</hi> and the <hi>Sacrament</hi> ſometymes in the <hi>Syriake,</hi> and moſt commonly in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue, which the common people vnderſtood not. And you ſay that againſt that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote that 14. chap. of the 1. to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> from whom therefore you ſay your <hi>Proteſtant doctrine</hi> is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as ours is from haeretiques.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For anſweare of this, and what els you are to ſay of your <hi>Succeſsion</hi> it is to bee noted, that it is one thing to proue a thing to haue beene anciently taught, another to haue beene ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiuely taught. For this later, beſids <hi>antiquity</hi> which it includeth, it importeth <hi>Continuance,</hi> and <hi>perpetuity without interruption.</hi> Soe that though it should bee true, which you ſay out of <hi>Wolphius, Epiphanius,</hi> and S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> yet were not that enough. For there bee ſome hundreds of yeares betweene <hi>Pope Vitalian</hi> and the <hi>Oſſeni,</hi> and more from S. <hi>Paul's</hi> tyme to this of ours, from which notwitſtanding, you draw your doctrine without any body betweene, now for the ſpace of 1500. yeares. Beſids when we ſpeake of <hi>Succeſsion</hi> in perſon in theſe matters, it is vnderſtood principally of perſons in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity one ſucceding the other in place and office. For we ſee in kingdomes and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealthes,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2521:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <hi>Succeſsion</hi> is to bee conſidereth moſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of the Gouerners and rulers, and in the <hi>Church</hi> the reaſon is more ſpecial, becauſe the Rulers thereof are <hi>Doctours</hi> by office. As for <hi>Succeſsion in doctrine</hi> to ſpeake properly and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely the <hi>Succeſsion</hi> is not to be conſidered in the <hi>doctrine</hi> it ſelfe, for that muſt be alwaies the ſame; but it is to bee conſidered in the <hi>Men.</hi> Soe that they ſucceede one another, not onely in place and office, but alſo in the ſame Doctrine; that is holding the ſame Doctrine which their Predeceſſors haue held, as they hold the ſame place.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This premiſed, which cannot be denied, I thinke noe man wilbe able in all that the <hi>Knight</hi> ſaith in this Section, to finde ſoe much as a shaddow of <hi>Succeſsion</hi> either in perſon or Doctrine, either againſt vs or for himſelf. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore I shall endeauour onely to diſcouer his falshood and corruptions, in charging vs with ancient haereſies. For <hi>Latine ſeruice</hi> then, that it should be firſt brought in by <hi>Vitalian,</hi> it is a moſt ſtrange abſurdity for this <hi>knight</hi> to auerre ſuch a knowne falshood, vpon noe other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority then <hi>Volphiu's,</hi> a profeſſed haeretique; and who can haue noe other ground, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that <hi>Pope</hi> liued about the yeare 666. which number is the name of the beaſt in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> though if he, that is, <hi>Wolphius</hi> would make a myſtery of the yeare wherein S. <hi>Vitalian</hi> liued, I ſee not why he should take the 666. which was the eleuenth of his

               <hi>Popedome,</hi> rather then the yeare 655. or 669. which were the firſt and laſt yeares thereof. which being ſoe ridiculouſly falſe, I will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to bring proofes againſt it, leaſt I may gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue occaſion to any man to thinke that there is any the leaſt likelyhood in it. For during thoſe 600. and odd yeares, what other Liturgies were there in the <hi>Latine Church</hi> but <hi>Latine,</hi> of which the very name of <hi>Latine Church</hi> giueth ſufficient teſtimony: if not <hi>Latine,</hi> lett this <hi>Knight</hi> or his freind <hi>Wolphius</hi> ſay what Language was in vſe before.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As for the <hi>Oſſeni</hi> whom our <hi>Knight</hi> would place vpwards towards the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> yet after their tyme, for he goeth aſcendeing vpwards as he ſaith, he is notably miſtaken in the tyme. For <hi>Epiphanius</hi> maketh them one of the ſeauen Sects, which were among the <hi>Iewes</hi> before <hi>Chriſt's</hi> coming. For thus hee ſaith. <hi>Poſt relatas Samaritarum &amp; ſuperius Graecorum indicatas Sectas ſeptem fuerunt haereſes apud Iudaeos ante Chriſti in carne aduentum?</hi>

twice ouer, and the ſecond tyme yet more attentiuely then the firſt, I could not find any ſuch word as the <hi>Knight</hi> citeth out of him, to wit, that <hi>there was no neede to make a prayer in a knowne tongue.</hi> Indeede it was one of <hi>Elxais</hi> hereſies (who liued long after in <hi>Traian's</hi> ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and whom S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ioyneth with the <hi>Oſſeni</hi>) that men muſt not pray towards the Eaſt as then was the generall cuſtome of the Church. Which error, is not to bee compared with the leaſt of a hundred which our Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques now adayes maintaine, and yet they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth make noe matter of, becauſe they are not fundamentall.</p>
            <p n="5">5. For the place of S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> if a <hi>Catholique</hi> should vrge him or his Miniſters with an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority out of that worke, they would make anſweare it were not S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his, and they would fill their margents with citations taken out of our authors. Which exception though I might in like ſort make, yet I doe not; becauſe the author is ancient, though not knowne, nor his doctrine in all things ſoe currant. But for this place, the <hi>Knight</hi> hath ſoe mangled &amp; gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, yet putting all in a different letter, as if they were the author's words, that when I came to reade the author, and ſee him ſoe cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, I beganne to thinke whether that were the place. But finding that there could be noe other, and that it is like in ſome words, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that this muſt be it. The author then commenting vpon the 14. Chap. of the 1. to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2521:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> where S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of ſome that did vſe the guift of tongues for oſtentation: ſaith thus. <hi>Hi ex Hebraeis erant qui aliquando Syra lingua, plaerumque Hebraea in tractatibus aut oblationibus vtebantur ad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendationem: gloriabantur enim ſe dici Hebraeos propter meritum Abrahae. Theſe were of the Hebrews who ſometymes vſed the Syriack but moſt part the Hebrew in their treatiſes,</hi> that is, (<hi>ſpeaches</hi> or <hi>exhortations) or Oblations, for oſtentation. For they did boaſt that they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Hebrews, for the merit of Abraham.</hi> Theſe are the words of the author truely reported, and truely tranſlated. Whereas the <hi>knight</hi> put this praeface, that <hi>there were certaine Iewes among the Graecians, as namely the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> which words are not in this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. Then he goeth on thus: (<hi>who did ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the diuine Seruice and Sacraments</hi> &amp;c. Whereas in the author there is neither the word <hi>(celebrate),</hi> nor the word <hi>(diuine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice)</hi> much leſſe the word <hi>(Sacraments);</hi> all that hath any shew of a thing like is, that word <hi>(oblationibus);</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>offering,</hi> whereof ſome may be made by Lay men and women, as the Puritane Miniſters finde full oft to their profit, without any celebration or Sacraments, the word <hi>(tractatibus)</hi> ſignifieth ſpeaches or exhortations by word or writing, and ſoe S. <hi>Aug.</hi> calleth the expoſitors of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <hi>tractatores.</hi>

               </note> Laſtly whereas the author de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the end for which they vſed thoſe ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2521:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to wit for oſtentation bragging that they were <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> for the meritt of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> this <hi>knight</hi> leaueth all that out, and putteth in theſe words of his owne <hi>which the common people vnderſtood not,</hi> as if they were the author's words. Now though this autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity doe not import much either one way or other, yet a man may by it ſee the honeſty and fidelity of this <hi>knight,</hi> who in all this ſentence which he maketh 9. lines in his booke, he hath not one word right cited, but onely theſe <hi>(Sometymes in the Syriacke and moſt commonly in the Hebrew tongue)</hi> which being taken alone what ſenſe can they haue, and yet how many lines a man is faine to write to lay open his naughty dealinge?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Another point of our doctrine, to wit, <hi>tranſubſtantiation</hi> hee draweth from the Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques <hi>Helieſaitae,</hi> which fained a twofold <hi>Chriſt</hi> one in heauen another in earth, out of <hi>Theodoret.</hi> And from one <hi>Marcus</hi> an Haeretique who by his inuocation ouer the Sacramental cupp, as the <hi>knight</hi> ſaith, cauſed the wine to appeare like bloud, out of S. <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> And laſtly from the <hi>Capharnaits</hi> in <hi>Chriſt's</hi> tyme, out of his owne braine, and ſoe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth our Succeſſion in doctrine and perſon to bee drawne from Idolaters, Haeretiques, and Capharnaits. Of the firſt of theſe three <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſaith, that thoſe haeretiques made two <hi>Chriſts</hi> one below, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aboue; of whom they ſay that he had dwelt in many before, and at laſt came downe
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:2521:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hither; or as others declare it; that at laſt he came and reſted in <hi>IESVS</hi> the Sonne of <hi>MARY.</hi> An haeretical fable indeede, which noe man can tell what to make of? but wherein is it like to our <hi>tranſubſtantiacion?</hi> theſe haeretiques make two <hi>Chriſts</hi> wee acknowledge but <hi>one;</hi> and the ſame both in heauen and in the conſecrated hoſt. <hi>Marcus,</hi> as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaith, by the helpe of the Diuell through art magique, changed the colour of the wine in the <hi>cup or chalice,</hi> which the <hi>knights</hi> is pleaſed of himſelf to call <hi>ſacramentall,</hi> into ſeueral colours. The <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Prieſt</hi> doth the cleane contrary; for the colour and other accidents remayning, he changeth the ſubſtance of the wine into the <hi>Bloud of Chriſt,</hi> by the Omnipotent power of almighty <hi>God.</hi> For the <hi>Capharnaits,</hi> they thought they should eate <hi>Chriſt's body</hi> peece meale, and after the manner of the flesh whereon they feede; we receiue <hi>Chriſt</hi> whole and entire, not in the forme and shape of flesh, but of breade; and in a ſpiritual, though real manner. What likeneſſe then in all theſe doctrines with ours, to a man in his right witts?</p>
            <p n="7">7. A third point is of the <hi>Supremacy of the Pope,</hi> which he fetcheth from <hi>Phocas</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour who he ſaith firſt gaue it to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> 600. yeares after <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But to giue vs more antiquity, he ſaith the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tils were our firſt founders, and benefactors.

This is his diſcourſe. To which I anſweare, that the <hi>knight</hi> is egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly miſtaken in ſaying that <hi>Phocas</hi> gaue that authority to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> though if hee should haue giuen it, or rather attempted to giue that which he could not giue to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> what is that to vs?

How then could it come from him? But this sheweth the <hi>knight's</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and abſurdity (which is our buſines in this place) firſt in ſaying that <hi>Phocas</hi> made ſuch a Decree in behalf of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> which sheweth his ignorance, for that Decree was made by <hi>Phocas</hi> in fauour of <hi>Bonifacius Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> againſt the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Secondly in alleadging that for a reaſon or ground of the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Rome's</hi> authority, which is commonly alleadged euen by Proteſtants againſt it, who by exalting the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> would willingly depreſſe the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p n="9">9.

A fift point is <hi>Communion in one kind,</hi> which hee ſaith wee haue from the <hi>Manichees,</hi> and from the <hi>Nazarites,</hi> who it is not like as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> ſaith, did drinke of the Chalice againſt their Vow, nor yet like that they did wholy abſtaine from the <hi>Communion:</hi> Out of which hee gathereth that they did communicate in one kinde onely. And heere ſaith the <hi>Knight,</hi> is their beſt Succeſſion from Haeretiques, and an vncertaine example of the <hi>Nazarites.</hi> Whereas his doctrine (he ſaith) is taught by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> himſelf, <hi>Drinke yee all of this.</hi> This is the <hi>Knight's</hi> diſcourſe. But to anſweare him, I ſay, that before euer there was <hi>Manichee</hi> in the world, the <hi>B. Sacrament</hi> was adminiſtred, ſometymes in one kind, ſometymes in both. The <hi>Manichees</hi> abſtained indeede from receiuing the chalice, out of one haeretical principle, as now our Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques ſtand to haue it for another like prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; againſt which as in that tyme the <hi>Church</hi> forbad the vſe of one kind, ſoe now it forbiddeth the vſe of both kinds, and may againe giue way when it shall ſeeme conuenient for the vſe of both kinds, the doctrine euer remayning the ſame, as vpon another occaſion I ſaid before. For that word of our <hi>Sauiour Drinke yee all of this,</hi> from whence the <hi>Knight</hi> draweth the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:2521:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his <hi>doctrine,</hi> it was ſpoken onely to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and in them to <hi>Prieſts</hi> not to the <hi>Layity.</hi> Of which I shall haue occaſion to ſpeake agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne afterwards.</p>
            <p n="10">10. But to come to an end of this matter, the <hi>Knight</hi> draweth our <hi>inuocation of Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> from the <hi>Angelici,</hi> our <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogation</hi> from the <hi>Cathari,</hi> our <hi>Worship</hi> of the <hi>B.

But this ſerueth for nothing,<note place="margin">V. Gual. chron.</note> but to shew the man's shameleſneſſe more and more. For the <hi>Angelici</hi> they were He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, ſwaruing from the rule of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique faith, by exceſſe, that is, honouring An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels more then their dew, or more then creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res; as Heretiques of theſe tyme doe by defect; that is, not honouring them ſoe much as is dew nor as creatures ſpecially honoured &amp; imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>God,</hi> for the good of mankind. The <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thari</hi> or <hi>Puritans</hi> as he interpreteth the word himſelf, a man would thinke should belong more to him that is either a Puritane or a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or at leaſt a Reformer, then to vs <hi>Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques.</hi> But the <hi>Cathari</hi> were <hi>No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>atians,</hi> who out of pride and ſelf conceit, as if they were more cleane and holy did condemne <hi>Catholiques,</hi> for admitting men to pennance, though they ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned neuer ſoe often &amp; ſoe grieuouſly, whereas
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2521:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they, Saints forſooth, if a man did for feare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his faith, they would haue nothing to doe with him any more. Now what is in this, like our <hi>works</hi> of <hi>Supererogation</hi> that is works which a man is not bound vnto? The <hi>Collyridians</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the meaſure of honour dew to our B. <hi>Lady,</hi> for they did offer ſacrifice vnto her, as the <hi>Antidico Marianitae</hi> did erre contrarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying her dew honour, whom the <hi>Knight</hi> did forbeare to name, leſt he might ſeeme to name his owne ſect. Now <hi>Catholiques</hi> goe in the midle they doe not offer ſacrifice vnto her, that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour being dew to <hi>God</hi> alone, but they giue her all the honour that can belong to a pure crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Tatianus</hi> and the <hi>Manichees</hi> diſallowed all marriage, but that they did diſallow it ſpecially in <hi>Prieſts</hi> I doe not find in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> as the <hi>Knight</hi> would make men beleeue by putting the words (<hi>in Sacerdotibus</hi> in Latine and in a diſtinct letter. Though indeede it be leſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable in Prieſts then in other men.</p>
            <p n="11">11. It being then ſoe, that of theſe haereſies which heere the <hi>Knight</hi> reckoneth, &amp; whereof he would make vs guilty, there is not one of them that any way co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerneth vs, but rather as a man might eaſily proue that he &amp; his Church are guilty of almoſt all of them, how vainely and fondly doth hee conclude this Section, by ſaying theſe and the like errours taught in the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are either lineally deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the aforeſaid Haeretiques, or at leaſt haue neere affinity with them? how vaine I
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:2521:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſay and fond is this ſaying of his? how neere they come, any man may iudge, by what I haue heere ſaid; as alſo of the linealnes of the diſcent of our Doctrines from former Haeretiques or of his from the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> For whereas the line should be drawne along by a continued Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, from the beginning to the end, hee nameth ſometymes one onely man or tyme for the whole 1500. yeares, ſometymes not ſoe much as one man, but onely a bare place of ſcripture corrupted or miſinterpreted. Which what <hi>Succeſsion</hi> it may make, let any indifferent man be iudge. Wherein it ſeemeth the very guiltines of his owne conſcience doth make him miſdoubt a little, that he hath not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently performed his promiſe, as may bee gathered out of theſe words of his. (<hi>If I haue failed in calculating the right natiuity of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient doctrine,</hi> &amp;c.) but for all that, he ſaith, he is ſure, that wee are vtterly deſtitute of a right Succeſſion in perſon and Doctrine from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>ancient Fathers,</hi> as hee ſaith shall appeare by many teſtimonies of the beſt learned among <hi>vs.</hi> But the <hi>knight</hi> hath ſoe ill performed his promiſes paſt, that hee cannot looke any man should giue him credit for thoſe that are to come. And for that which hee is ſure of, that we haue noe Succeſſion in perſon and doctrine, that is ſoe falſe and ſoe apparantly falſe, as that it is not to bee doubted, but he that shall auerre it will make noe ſcruple of any lye how lowd ſoeuer.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:2521:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For doe not our catalogues of <hi>Popes</hi> ſold and printed in London teſtify the contrary? for Succeſſion in perſon what clearer teſtimony can there be in the world of perſonal Succeſſion then to haue two hundred and odd Popes one ſucceeding the other in place and office, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cizing the ſame authority and iuriſdiction in the ſight of the whole world? Now out of this perſonal Succeſſion, we <hi>Catholiques</hi> draw a moſt firme argument of Succeſſion in faith and beleife as hee calleth it, as the holy <hi>Fathers</hi> haue euer done againſt Heretiques of their tymes. Which ſoe long as it ſtandeth good; it is in vaine for Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> and ſuch men to cry out that wee haue noe Succeſſion in doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. Lett them shew when, where, in what <hi>Popes</hi> tyme, and by whom it was interrupted or broken of, or els they ſay nothing. And ſoe leauing him to find that out I paſſe to another Section.</p>

            <p n="1">1. THe title of this Sectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> promiſeth much, and the beginning of the Section it ſelf much more. For in it he ſaith, that if the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doe not plainely confeſſe the antiquity of his Church, his Tenets, and the nouelty of her owne; if <hi>she</hi> doe not proclaime the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſality of the Proteſtant faith, and confeſſe it both more certaine and ſafe, <hi>hee will neither refuſe the name nor punishment dew to haeresy;</hi> Which how bold and vnlikely an aduenture it is I preſume there is noe man of iudgment be hee neuer ſoe much freind euen to Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> himſelf that doth not at the very firſt ſight perceiue? how shameleſſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent it is, I doubt not but vpon a little examination I halbee able euidently to decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, and conſequently how truely both the name and punishment of <hi>haeresy</hi> is dew vnto
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2521:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him, euen by his owne doome. Wherein I shall craue thine attention <hi>Good Reader,</hi> that perceiuing how well and truelly <hi>hee</hi> perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth this promiſe ſoe great, and vpon ſoe hard conditions Voluntarily vndertaken in caſe of not performance thou maiſt frame a right iudgment of the whole booke by this one chapter. And as thou findeſt him to deale heere ſoe to thinke of his dealing els where. But not to ſay more I come to the triall of the matter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hee pretendeth then to bring the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of our authors, or to ſpeake in his owne phraſe, the confeſſion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> touching the Antiquity and Vniuerſality, Certainety, and Safety of his <hi>faith;</hi> which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer heareth, would hee not expect the man should bring ſome definition of a <hi>Councel</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, or ſome <hi>Decree</hi> of the <hi>See Apoſtolique,</hi> for that onely is the confeſſion of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> would not a man expect, he should bring ſome few authors two or three at leaſt, acknowledging all theſe points, or ſome one author for each point; or ſome one author at leſt for ſome one of them? ſurely he would. And yet doth the <hi>Knight</hi> nothing of all this: he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not one author, I ſay not one, for the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſality or a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiquity, &amp;c. of his Church. Though if he should haue one, two, three, or ten men, it would not be ſufficient for him; vnleſſe he haue the authority of the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> or
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2521:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> For that is it which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth. But lett vs heare what he ſaith.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In all this Section he bringeth onely three Catholique authors; <hi>Adrian, Coſterus,</hi> and <hi>Harding,</hi> for the three ſeueral points of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſtantiation, Communion in one kind,</hi> and <hi>priuate Maſſe,</hi> as he calleth it, in this manner. Hee ſaying of himſelf, that when Proteſtants ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe vs of adoring the elements of bread and wine, we excuſe it by ſaying we adore it vpon condition: and for that end bringeth theſe words of <hi>Adrian. Adoro te ſi tu es Chriſtus. I adore thee if thou bee Chriſt.</hi> Soe of <hi>Communion in one kind,</hi> when they accuſe vs of taking away the cupp from the Layity, we excuſe it: and thereto hee bringeth <hi>Coſterus</hi> ſaying, that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion vnder one kind was not taken vpp by the commandement of the Byshops, but it crept in, the Byshops winking thereat.</hi> Thirdly when they accuſe vs for our <hi>priuate Maſſes</hi> contrary to <hi>Chriſt's</hi> inſtitution, we excuſe it; and for that end he bringeth theſe words of <hi>Doctor Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. It is through their owne fault and negligence; whereof the godly and faithfull people, ſince the tyme of the primitiue Church, haue much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</hi> Theſe three be all the authors he hath and this all he ſaith out of them, in which any man may ſee whether there bee a word, or shadow of a word for the antiquity or Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſality of the Proteſtant faith in generall, as the title of his Section goeth.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:2521:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>4. I ſay nothing heere of the man's notable cunning and falshood, in pretending &amp; making his <hi>Reader,</hi> beleeue as if we did excuſe our ſelues in thoſe things whereof they accuſe vs: whereby wee might ſeeme to acknowledge ſome fault, whereas there is noe ſuch matter in the world, nor one word ſpoken by any man, by way of excuſe as shall appeare. For noe <hi>Catholique</hi> but ſcorneth an excuſe in matter of his <hi>beleife</hi> though for life, ſome may haue ſome what which may neede excuſe, though in that caſe, we teach an humble confeſsion to bee the beſt excuſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But to come now to the matter lett vs heare what it is theſe authors ſay. <hi>Adrian</hi> as he telleth vs excuſeth our adoration of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of bread and wine, becauſe we adore it vpon condition <hi>if the conſecrated bread bee Chriſt;</hi> the Latine words of <hi>Adrian</hi> in the marge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t are theſe <hi>Adoro te ſi tu es Chriſtus.</hi> Which words indeade <hi>Adrian</hi> hath, but they are very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from Sir <hi>Humphrey's</hi> English as any man may of himſelf ſee, and ſpoken by <hi>Adrian</hi> vpon a very different occaſion, as I shall now shew. Hee then diſputing whether a Iudge may without ſinne wish he might lawfully giue iudgment againſt iuſtice, and bringing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> (as <hi>Diuines</hi> doe), for the affirmatiue, he bringeth this. That the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the ſinne is taken away and cleared by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition which is added: which hee farther proueth by two arguments: the one that the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:2521:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Conſtance</hi> doth excuſe ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple adoring an vnconſecrated hoſt, becauſe this condition is tacitely implied if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration be rightly made: the other that all Doctors agree that a man may auoide perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xity betweene idolatry and diſobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce when the Deuill ſoe transfiguring himſelfe as to ſeeme <hi>Chriſt</hi> commandeth one to adore; if vpon condition he adore thus. I adore thee if thou be <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This is what <hi>Adrian</hi> hath. Wherein firſt any man may ſee he ſpeaketh nothing of his owne opinion but of others, and that by way of diſpute only. Secondly the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which is tacitly implied in the adoration of an vnconſecrated hoſt according to the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Conſtance</hi> is not that which Sir <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> putteth, to wit, if the conſecrated bread bee <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but this other, if it bee righty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated which is cleane another matter; for his condition euer ſuppoſing a right conſecration maketh doubt whither <hi>Chriſt</hi> be there or not which is moſt falſe, the other condition ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth noe doubt of that but onely whither this particular hoſt be rightly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated manifeſtly ſuppoſing that if that be, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is truely there. Thirdly that other condition or words. <hi>Adoro te ſi tu es Chriſtus:</hi> which he would make a man beleeue were ſpoken by <hi>Adrian</hi> of the moſt <hi>B. Sacrament</hi> are ſpoken of the Diuell taking vpon him the shape of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Now what groſſe deluſion is this? What excuſe can you finde for it Sir <hi>Humphrey?</hi> But
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:2521:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſuppoſe <hi>Adrian</hi> had erred in this or in any other particular point, either ignorantly as a Catholique may, or wilfully as onely Haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques doe: Doth it follow that he agreeth with you in all other or that hee-counteth your <hi>faith</hi> ancient, vniuerſall, certaine, or ſafe? noe ſuch matter; nay how on the contrary he abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth &amp; deteſteth your doctrine as moſt wicked and damnable is plainely to be ſeene by a <hi>Bull</hi> which he writ to <hi>Fredericke</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> againſt <hi>Luther</hi> and his Doctrine diſprouing euery point thereof, exhorting the ſaid <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> to forſake it and returne to the true <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique faith</hi> now in the dayes of <hi>Adrian Pope</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> Emperour as the <hi>Saxons</hi> did at firſt embrace it in the tyme of the firſt <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> of the ſame names and then liuing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. With a great deale to the ſame purpoſe. What madnes then is it to alleadge a Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Diuine, a Pope and ſuch a Pope for the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity and Vniuerſality of your beleife.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Now for <hi>Coſterus</hi> you ſay he excuſeth the taking away, of the cupp from the Layity. But if you would giue a man leaue to bee ſoe bold with your worshipp, I would know what excuſe you can find for ſuch a notorious lye? If he excuſes it he acknowledgeth the thing to neede excuſe and conſequently to be ill; and I pray you where doe you find him doe that? noe where verily. For he hath one ſpecial title of this controuerſy; wherein he proueth
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:2521:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the truth of the Catholique faith in this point, by ten ſeuerall reaſons, and ſolueth ſixteene obiections as well of former as later Haeretiques againſt it. If this be to excuſe, I know not what it is to maintaine and make good a thing.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <note place="margin">Enchirid.</note>8. But now to come to <hi>Coſterus,</hi> he by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſoluing an obiection, ſaith that the cuſtome of communicating in one kind began from the people; for it hauing euer beene free to communicate in one kind, or both, as <hi>Coſterus</hi> there often repeateth, the people for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modityes, by little and little abſtained from the chalice, which abſtayning of theirs the <hi>Bishops</hi> for other reaſons alſoe, by ſilence appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Whereby you ſee his meaning is plaine and cleare againſt you. And for his words, whereas you relate them thus. <hi>It was not taken vpp by the comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dment of the Bishops, but it crept in the Bishops winking thereat:</hi> They are indeede thus. <hi>It is to bee diligently noted, that the communion of one kind crept in, not ſoe much by the commandment of the Bishops as by the vſe and practize of the people, yet the Bishops winking thereat.</hi> Wherein though there be but a little difference yet it sheweth your fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity according to our <hi>Sauiour's</hi> ſaying:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luc</hi> 16.10.</note> 
               <hi>Qui in modico iniquus eſt, &amp; in maiori iniquus eſt. He that wicked in a little is wicked in a greater.</hi> For <hi>Coſterus</hi> doth not ſay, that it did not come in by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the <hi>Bishops,</hi> but not ſoe much by that as by the peoples vſe and practize.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Now what is this to your purpoſe, where is
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2521:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Coſterus</hi> his teſtimony for the antiquity, vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſality, certainty, and ſafety of your <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant religion?</hi> is not that whole booke written Onely to maintaine the <hi>Catholique Romane faith</hi> in the points now adayes in controuerſy, and to condemne the contrary of vanity folly and error? how then can he thinke it ſalfe? But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I will not ſtand to deduce it by way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. I will onely cite one place directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the ſcope of this your ſection; Where he ſaith that onely the <hi>children of the Church,</hi>

third author of ours, which you bring to proue the Antiquity, Vniuerſality, Certainty, and Safety of your <hi>faith,</hi> let vs heare how you vſe him.

For you doe not expreſſe who it is that <hi>Doctor Harding</hi> ſpeaketh of, when hee ſaith it is <hi>their owne default;</hi> neither can it be himſelf or Catholiques in generall, for then he would haue expreſſed it in the firſt perſon: ſaying <hi>it is our owne fault:</hi> and if it bee not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf nor Catholiques in generall, then can it bee noe excuſe; for they be Catholiques in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall or the Catholique Church which you accuſe; and the accuſation and excuſe muſt anſweare one the other.</p>

            <p n="14">14. Well thus much then for theſe three authors whom you haue ſoe egregiouſly bely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now lett vs heare what you ſay of your owne or of your ſelfe. You ſay our beſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (yet you name none) decline thoſe our traditions which you deny: and that the moſt ingenious of vs are ashamed of thoſe additions which you deny.

For example you ſay when we are charged with worshipping of images we deny it, or excuſe the manner of adoration, but doe not condemne you for not worshipping the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But good Sir I pray you what <hi>Catholique</hi> denieth the worshipping of images what? <hi>Catholique</hi> doth excuſe the manner of worshipp. Name the man if you can?

For it is a farr greater euill for you to be truely charged with haereſy, then for vs to be charged fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely with idolatry.

But this is not a matter of any moment. For they who call your religion negatiue, doe not meane that you doe not teach any poſitiue erroneous point, but that moſt of your doctrine I meane that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2521:87"/>
which is properly yours, not taken from vs, is negatiue; and euen thoſe affirmatiue propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which you teach, if you teach any, are but contradictions of other things, which we teach are not, or may not be done. In which reſpect, they may be alſo called <hi>negatiue.</hi> But for ours it is nothing ſoe, for it conſiſteth of poſitiue points, deliuered not by way of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition or denyal; for it was before all haereſy; though it is true that it hath many negatiue propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and praecepts. Beſides out of euery poſitiue point a man may inferre the contrary negatiue: Which yet maketh not that a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, as you doe in ſome of thoſe propoſitions which you alleadge; for example you make this a negatiue point, that we deny the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of bread to remaine after co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas that is onely a negatiue inferred out of this poſitiue, that the ſubſtance of the bread and wine is cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged into the body and bloud of our Bleſſed Sauiour, which is our doctrine, &amp; euer was before any <hi>haereſy</hi> aroſe: but an haereſy ariſing to the contrary, as that the ſubſtance of bread remaineth after conſecration: the <hi>Church</hi> out of that poſitiue point deduceth this nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, that the ſubſtance of breade doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, for deſtruction of that haereſy.

                  </note> to wit, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of the vncertainty of our owne iuſtice, that is whether we be iuſt or noe, and for the peril of vaine glory, it is moſt ſafe to putt our whole confidence in the <hi>Sole mercy</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity of GOD.</hi> Which word <hi>Sole</hi> doth import confidence in that, and in nothing els. With which it may ſtand very well, that men in the fauour and grace of God, may doe works me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious of increaſe of grace and glory, which is the controuerſy betweene Vs and Haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques. For men may bee in grace and not know it, they may doe thoſe good works and yet not know that their works haue that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural goodnes, purity of intention, and other perfection which is neceſſary to make it meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, all which makes vs vncertaine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we merit or not, though we be neuer ſoe certaine that if our Workes be ſuch as they should bee, they are meritorious. And to this purpoſe is the diſcourſe of the <hi>Councel of Trent</hi> in the end of the 16. Chapter of the 6.

And all this anſweare is, ſuppoſing you cite your author true, for I haue not ſeene him: nor doth it ſoe much import to ſee him. But if it bee not againſt vs why will you ſay doth the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> correct it.

But how ſoeuer the booke is not of any knowne good author and it hath been printed and reprinted now in this tyme of haereſy &amp; by Haeretiques and therefore may well fall vnder the <hi>Inquiſition's</hi> correction as giuing iuſt cauſe of ſuſpition that they thruſt words in for their owne purpoſes.

I will therefore truely tranſlate them; and then obſerue your Doctor's corruption and yours the true tranſlation is this. <hi>The body in which Chriſt ſuffered, and this body which is celebrated euery day by the faithfull in miſtery</hi> (that is, as a myſtery, or myſtical repreſentation and commemoration) <hi>of the paſsion are ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by much difference</hi> (that is, are very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, or doe much differ) <hi>for that flesh which was crucified was made of the flesh of the Virgin, compacted with bones and nerues</hi> (or ſinewes) <hi>and diſtinguished by lineaments of humane limbs liu'd</hi> (or made liuing) <hi>by the ſpirit of a reaſonable Soule vnto proper life and congruent</hi> (or agreeable) <hi>motions; but the Spiritual flesh, which Spiritually feedeth the beleeuing people, according to the shew which it carrieth outwardly, conſiſteth of graines of corne, by the hand of the artificer, not compact</hi> (or knit together) <hi>with any finewes and bones, not diſtinguished by any variety of members, not vegetated or liu'd by any reaſonable ſubſtance, not able to exerciſe any proper motions. For whatſoeuer in it giueth the Subſtance of life, is of Spiritual power, inuiſible working, and diuine vertue.</hi> Now lett any man compare <hi>Dr. Vsher's</hi> and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:2521:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sir <hi>Humphrey Lind's</hi> English, and ſee whether agree better with the Latine theirs or this, though they differ ſomewhat betweene them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; but I will chiefly follow my owne chaſe of the <hi>Knight's</hi> tranſlation. He shall find firſt in theſe words, <hi>(Hoc corpus quod in myſterio paſsionis Chriſti quotidie a fidelibus celebratur. This body which is daily celebrated by the faithfull in myſtery of the paſsion)</hi> the word <hi>(hoc)</hi> left out. And all the other words, ſaue onely the word <hi>(Corpus)</hi> the reſt (becauſe there is me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion made of daily cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration as a myſtery of the Paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as is practized in the <hi>Catholique Church</hi>) they change in the tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlation. The <hi>Knight</hi> thus, the <hi>body which is receiued of the faithfull;</hi> the Dr. a little otherwiſe, but I let him alone, wherein any man may ſee the <hi>knight's</hi> bad meaning.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Secondly the knight ſaith <hi>the body that Chriſt ſuffered in was borne of the flesh of Mary,</hi> &amp;c. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas the true English is this. <hi>The flesh which was crucified was made of the flesh of the Virgin.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in though to the Vulgar Reader there may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare but ſmall difference betweene <hi>(borne)</hi> and <hi>(made:)</hi> yet there is a great deale: for <hi>Aelfrick's</hi> oppoſition doth not conſiſt in this, that <hi>the flesh crucified was borne of the Virgin,</hi> and the other not; as the <hi>knight</hi> would make a man beleeue; but it conſiſteth in the matter whereof the body on the croſſe, and the body in the Sacrament are made. For as it is in the Sacrament, it is made of bread, <hi>tanquam materia tranſeunte</hi> as <hi>Diuines</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke: and not of the Flesh of the Virgin, but that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:2521:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
flesh is the <hi>terminus ad quem</hi> of the tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating action or that whereinto the ſubſtance ob bread is changed, though it be the ſame body that was borne of her. And this shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>knight's</hi> cunning corruption, how great it may bee in matter and ſubſtance, though the word be neuer ſoe like, or little.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Thirdly whereas the <hi>knight</hi> ſaith <hi>with bloud and with bone, with skin, and with Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, in humane limbs with a reaſonable ſoule.</hi> The Latine hath not the word <hi>bloud,</hi> nor the word <hi>skin.</hi> And the <hi>Knight</hi> on the other ſide leaueth the word <hi>(compacta.) Compacted with bones and ſinews.</hi> And thoſe words <hi>(in humane limbs)</hi> are farre otherwiſe in the Latine, as any man may ſee to wit thus <hi>diſtinguished by humane limbs.</hi> All which putting in and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out chopping and changing though it may ſeeme not to make much either way, yet it is very like it is vſed by this <hi>Knight</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure the author's meaning and drift; which is by all theſe particulars to shew the difference betweene <hi>Chriſt</hi> vpon the croſſe, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the B. Sacrament; that is the difference in his manner of being, not in his being it ſelfe; nor denying him to be really in both; which is that the <hi>knight</hi> would obſcure and make ſeeme as if this author meant, it were not the ſame <hi>Chriſt</hi> that were in both. Which is very falſe; which his bad meaning is farther diſcouered in that which followeth. For hauing putt downe theſe words <hi>(with a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2521:93"/>
reaſonable ſoule liuing)</hi> which yet doe not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſoe well anſweare to the Latine words <hi>(rationalis animae ſpiritu viuificata)</hi> he leaueth out theſe other immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>in propriam vitam &amp; congruentes motus.</hi> By which it is ſignified that <hi>Chriſt's</hi> flesh cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied vpon the croſſe, had a reaſonable ſoule, whereby not onely to liue, but to be able to shew this life by action, and motion agreable therevnto, which words explane the former, and are very pertinent to declare the meaning of what is ſaid on the contrary of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> body in the B. Sacrament, as by and by shall appeare.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Fourthly whereas the Latine ſaith, <hi>Caro ſpiritualis, ſpiritual flesh,</hi> the <hi>knight</hi> tranſlateth it the <hi>ſpiritual body:</hi> which I onely note without ſtanding vpon it, for it is noe great matter. But that which cometh next is the maine corruption of all: For whereas <hi>Aelfricke</hi> ſaith that this ſpiritual flesh, which is as much to ſay as our <hi>Sauiour's</hi> flesh in the B. Sacrament, according to the outward shew which it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth, doth conſiſt of graines of corne, hath noe bones nor ſinewes, noe diſtinction of limbs, noe life or motion of it ſelfe the <hi>knight</hi> leaueth out thoſe words <hi>(Secundum ſpeciem quam gerit exterius, according to the shew which it carrieth outwardly)</hi> which are the very life of all that which followeth, to wit, that to ſee to, it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth of corne; to ſee to, it hath noe bones,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:2521:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and ſinewes; to ſee to, it hath noe diſtinction of parts; to ſee to, it hath noe ſoule, nor power to exerciſe any motion of it ſelfe, the <hi>knight</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Reader thinke, that <hi>Aelfricke</hi> ſaith our Sauiour's flesh in the B. Sacrement hath noe bones, noe parts, noe ſoule, &amp;c. which is a notorious falshood. Laſtly whereas the <hi>knight</hi> maketh this inference in the ſame pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, as if they were <hi>Aelfrick's words, therefore there is nothing to bee vnderſtood bodily but ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually. Aelfrick</hi> ſaith not ſoe, though that might bee ſaid in a good ſenſe but thus he ſaith. <hi>For whatſoeuer therein giueth the ſubſtance of life, is of ſpiritual power, inuiſible working and diuine vertue.</hi> In which there is a great deale of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene <hi>Aelfrick's (for),</hi> which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a reaſon for that which goeth before, and the <hi>knight's (therefore)</hi> which maketh an inference vpon that which was ſaid, which a learned man will eaſily perceiue to make a great deale of difference in the ſenſe, nay any man may ſee the difference betweene a reaſon and an inference. <hi>Aelfricke</hi> therefore plainely teacheth in theſe words that <hi>that flesh doth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue,</hi> but with all that <hi>that life proceedeth from a ſpiritual power and inuiſible working.</hi> Which agreeth very well with what he had ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that according to the outward shew, that flesh hath neither bones, nor ſinewes, nor limbs, nor life, nor motion, but that all theſe things are not ſeene, and that the life which it hath
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:2521:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
proceedeth from a ſpiritual power, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king which is not ſeene.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Now lett any man ſee whither this <hi>Knight</hi> haue not egregiouſly abuſed this ancient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, corrupting this little ſentence of his, by fiue great corruptions beſides other more of leſſe moment, which I haue beene ſomewhat longer in diſcouering, becauſe it is the man's maine proofe in this place and one of his two records as he calleth them, wherewith as it were with two ſpeciall and ancient euidences he preſenteth his Reader in the very beginning of this Section §. 1. and wherein therefore he hath vſed all the cunning he could deuiſe, to make this author ſpeake his Proteſtant lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and conſequently alſo the <hi>Bishops</hi> and other learned men of that tyme, who approued this Homily, if they did approue it; as hee ſaith, but in vaine as you may ſee by this that is ſaid, and by one place more which I will bring euen out of this <hi>Knight's</hi> maiſter <hi>Dr. Vsher,</hi> which shall plainely shew this <hi>Aelfrick's</hi> perfect Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique beleife in this point. The words are theſe. <hi>Sicut ergo paulo antequam pateretur, panis ſubſtantiam &amp; vini creaturam conuertere potuit in proprium corpus, quod paſſurum erat, &amp; in ſuum ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinem qui poſt fundendus extabat, ſic etiam in deſerto manna &amp; aquam de petra in ſuam carnem &amp; ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem conuertere praeualuit</hi> &amp;c. as therefore a little before he ſuffered, he could change the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of bread and the creature of wine into his proper body which was to ſuffer, and into
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:2521:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his bloud which was extant to be after shed. Soe in the deſert, he was able to change manna and water into his owne flesh and bloud, &amp;c. Where he sheweth plainely a conuerſion of bread and wine into that owne body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and bloud which was a little after to ſuffer and be shed which is nothing more then that which we call tranſubſtantiation. And out of this as a certaine truth <hi>he</hi> gathereth that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had alſo the power to turne manna and water into his body and bloud, as well as bread and wine. And ſoe it is, in reguard of the power it is all one; but in reguard that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not then in being, according to his humane nature, the manna could not be changed into his body and water into his bloud. Which place as plaine as it is, it is a ſtrange and almoſt incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible thing to ſee how <hi>D. Vsher</hi> (which I onely note by the way for my quarrel heere is not ſoe properly againſt him) doth peruert by his interpretation. For thus hee putteth the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish in the text. So he turned through inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vertue the bread to his owne body, and that wine to his bloud, as he before did in the wilderneſſe before that he was borne to men, when he turned that heauenly meate to his flesh, and the flowing water from that ſtone to his bloud. Wherein there is ſcarce one word truly tranſlated, which I will not ſtand to shew particularly, but not onely the maine corruption: that whereas <hi>Aelfricke</hi> ſaith that as Chriſt was able to turne the bread
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2521:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and wine, ſoe he was able to turne the manna and water. This man turneth it quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that as hee turned the manna and water, ſoe he turned the bread and wine: which is a foule corruption. But <hi>D. Vsher</hi> I heare is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently anſweared, and his corruptions laid open to the world if the books might be as freely printed and ſold as his. But therein they haue the aduantage of vs Catholiques that they haue free vſe of libraries and prints and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que allowance for the ſale. All which we want and therefore noe meruaile if books be not anſweared as freely as they are written. But this is but by the way.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Now then if thus much may be ſaid out of what <hi>D. Vsher</hi> picketh out for his owne pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, what may a man thinke might be ſaid, if a man ſaw the author himſelfe, who though he were printed in London as Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. 1623. yet is he not now to be heard of. But as I was ſaying all this sheweth this <hi>Aelfricke</hi> to haue beene a Catholique and that his doctrine was none other then the Doctrine of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church</hi> at this day. Wherefore Sir <hi>Knight, Campian's</hi> ſaying (which you account a vaine flourish) ſtandes good ſtill that you cannot eſpy ſoe much as one towne, one village, one howſe, for 1500. yeares that ſauoured of your Doctrine, and should ſtill be true, though you might find ſome one man or two or more, that did agree with you in your <hi>Berengarian</hi> haereſy; (though alſoe one man doe not make either towne
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:2521:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Village or howſe:) For your faith doth not conſiſt of this point alone. Nor did <hi>Campian</hi> meane, that there was neuer any man that did agree with you in any one of your erroneous points, but that there was neuer any houſe vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage or citty that did agree with you in your whole faith and religion or made the ſame Church with you. And for the mangling and razing one of <hi>Aelfrick's</hi> latine epiſtles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you charge vs firſt <hi>Sir</hi> it is not like by this that he ſaith in his Homily, wherewith you ſay the Epiſtles agree, that there is any thing againſt vs; and if there were know you <hi>Sir</hi> it is not our fashion to deale ſoe with authors; but if there bee any thing contrary to the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que faith, we doe what is to bee done publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quely, as hauing authority; and knowing what wee doe: correcting moderne authours in what they erre, &amp; for ancient authours, noting onely what is amiſſe,<note place="margin">V. reg. indi de correct. lib. <hi>§. 4.</hi>
                  </note> but not razing or blotting out any thing, that corner correcting we leaue for ſuch corner companions as shunne the light. And ſoe your principall argument being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweared, I goe on to the reſt.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Firſt, you tell vs wee are diuided among our ſelues touching the antiquity and Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of tranſubſtantiation: ſome deriuing it as you ſay from the words of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſome from his benediction before the words, ſome from the expoſition of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> ſome from the <hi>Councel of Lateran,</hi> ſome from Scriptures, ſome from the determination of the <hi>Church:</hi> where to fill
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:2521:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
paper and make a shew, you repeate againe the ſame things. For what difference, for as much as pertayneth to this matter, is there betweene the determination of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Councel of Lateran?</hi> betweene Scriptures and the words of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> But to let that goe I ſay, firſt, your phraſe of deriuing is improper, as you vſe it. For we deriue our Doctrine by Succeſſion from thoſe men that haue gone before vs by degrees to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> tyme, shewing that in all ages and tymes it hath beene taught and beleeued, but to ſpeake properly we not deriue but proue the truth of our doctrine, out of <hi>Scriptures, Councels, Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. though the deriuation be alſo a proofe, but yet different from that of Scriptures and Councels. Secondly you ſpeake very generally and confuſedly. For whereas there bee diuers things in queſtion betweene you and vs, as the realnes of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> preſence in the Bleſſed Sacrament and Tranſubſtantiation: others among Catholiques themſelues, as whither or how farr theſe points may bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued out of Scripture, Tradition &amp;c. or by what words or actions this change is made, you make no diſtinction at all of any of theſe things, nor ſpeake any thing certainely, or conſtantly of any of them, but runne hopping vpp and downe from one to another; now forward, now backward, that noe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can tell where to find you but though this confuſion of yours, cauſe a little more trouble and length in anſwearing, yet in the end it will diſcouer
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:2521:97"/>
your ignorance and vanity the more.</p>
               <p n="12">12. To begin then with you, I would know to what purpoſe you alleadge our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors in things controuerted among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues onely, eyther now becauſe they are not defined, or heertofore when other things then controuerted were not defined, though they be ſince, and conſequently out of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſy? Doth this difference of our authors ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke any thing for you? noe verily but much againſt you: for their modeſt manner of diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teing of theſe things with dew ſubmiſſion to the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> to whoſe cenſure they leaue themſelues, their opinions, and writings, &amp; their ſilence as ſoone as <hi>She</hi> doth ſpeake, is a manifeſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation of your haeretical pride that will ſtand to noe iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t but your owne: and euen thoſe opinions of theirs which you take hold of, they virtually retract, ſoe farre as either they may bee any way againſt the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Catholique Church, or in fauour of Haeretiques, which are the onely things you ſeeke. Therefore in any thing wherein they may diſſent from the common beleefe, as they doe not binde vs, ſoe they doe not fauour you. But of this I ſaid enough in the firſt Chapter. Though in the authorityes which you heere alleadge, there be not much neede of this: for either they ſay nothing againſt vs, or you cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt them as I shall shew.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And to begin with <hi>Caietan</hi> in matter of the <hi>real preſence,</hi> you ſay out of <hi>Suarez</hi> he
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:2521:97"/>
taught that <hi>theſe words (THIS IS MY BODY) doe not of them ſelues ſufficiently proue tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, without the ſuppoſed authority of the Church, and that therefore by command of Pius V.</hi> that <hi>part of his commentary is left out of the Romish edition.</hi> Thus you. Where firſt according to your vſuall liberty of falſifying, you put in the word <hi>(ſuppoſed)</hi> of your owne, to make the ſpeech ſound ſomewhat contemptibly of the <hi>Church.</hi> Whereas there is noe ſuch word in <hi>Suarez</hi> his Latine text which you cite in the margent. Secondly you putt in the word <hi>(Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation)</hi> which <hi>Suarez</hi> there ſpeaketh not of, as is euident, but onely of the <hi>real preſence,</hi> which is a diſtinct thing, though you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>found them. And in that <hi>Suarez</hi> indeede, &amp; the whole Schoole of <hi>Deuines</hi> doe worthily condemne <hi>Caietane,</hi> for ſaying that thoſe words <hi>(THIS IS MY BODY)</hi> doe not ſufficiently proue the <hi>real preſence of our Sauiour's body.</hi> For ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity whereof <hi>Caietan</hi> is often noted, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſuch moment, is very much to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in a <hi>Diuine,</hi> &amp; therefore <hi>Pius V.</hi> with great reaſon commanded that to be blotted out, agreeably to the rules praeſcribed in the <hi>Romane index,</hi> for correcting of books. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof you complaine much, as thinking <hi>Caie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane</hi> ſomewhat to fauour your ſide, yet you are extreamely miſtaken and by alleadging <hi>Caietanes</hi> authority in this, you giue your ſelfe a wound. For though hee doe not giue ſoe much to the bare words of the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2521:98"/>
Scripture, as to be ſufficient of themſelues to proue the Reality of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> preſence, yet hee ſaith that ioyning the authority of the Churches expoſition of them, they are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient: as he ſaith in expreſſe words which your ſelf after cite and yet you can alleadge him for you as you thinke heere, and which is more impudency, you are not ashamed to ſay that <hi>Caietan</hi> denieth the bread to bee tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by thoſe words: For where hath <hi>Caietan</hi> ſuch a word or euen shaddow of a word. You thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke perhaps becauſe in his opinion thoſe words doe not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly of themſelues proue the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> preſence, that therefore they doe not ſufficiently cauſe it: but if you thinke ſoe as you ſeeme, you are much miſtake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for thoſe are two different things. For example in Baptiſme the words <hi>I baptize thee</hi> &amp;c. beſides the clenſing of the ſoule from ſinne original &amp; actuall, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe alſo the remiſſion of the temporall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; imprint a ſpiritual character in the Soule though theſe effects cannot bee proued out of the ſignification of the wordes: and ſoe alſoe a man might ſay of the forme of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> the proofe depending vpon the ſpeculatiue ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the words, the preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon their efficacy, which they haue by the inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as they are the forme of this Sacrament, which might bee ſeparated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſignification though <hi>de facto</hi> it be not.<note place="margin">Caiet in com. <hi>3.</hi> p. q. <hi>75.</hi> a. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> And ſoe <hi>Caietane</hi> though hee thinke not the bare ſignification of the words without the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:2521:98"/>
of the <hi>Church</hi> ſufficient to proue the preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> body in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; yet he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not to affirme with the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Florence</hi> alleadging the very words thereof, <hi>quod ipſorum verborum virtute ſubſtantia panis in corpus Chriſti, &amp; ſubſtantia vini in ſanguinem conuertuntur. That by the power of the very words the ſubſtance of the Bread is turned into the body of Chriſt, and the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the wine into his bloud.</hi> Soe as <hi>Caietan</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for you, but very much againſt you.</p>
               <p n="14">14. But yet you goe on confidently telling vs that you will produce <hi>Cardinals, Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Schoolemen</hi> to teſtify that there are noe words in ſcripture to proue <hi>tranſubſtantiation.</hi> Secondly that thoſe words <hi>This is my Body,</hi> are not of the eſſence of the Sacrament. Thirdly that the <hi>ancient Fathers</hi> did not beleeue the ſubſtance of the Sacramental bread to bee conuerted into <hi>Chriſt's real flesh.</hi> Fourthly that tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not beleeued <hi>de fide</hi> aboue 1000. yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res after <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Which fower points how well you proue I muſt now ſee Sir <hi>Humphrey.</hi> Firſt noting by the way that though you ſett them downe ſeuerally as if you meant to proue them in order one after another bringing one <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> one <hi>Bishop</hi> and one <hi>Schooleman</hi> at leaſt for euery one, yet you neither obſerue order, nor ſoe alleadge authors as shall appeare. Though for the firſt of your 4. points you neede not many authors, if you adde the word <hi>(expreſly)</hi> thus, that there bee no words in ſcripture to proue <hi>tranſubſtantiation</hi> expreſly: Which word if
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2521:99"/>
you putt in, your propoſition may paſſe for true; if not, it is falſe, and without author. For though all <hi>Catholiques</hi> ſaue onely <hi>Caietan</hi> agree, that the words of conſecration of themſelues, proue the reality of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> preſence, yet all doe not ſoe agree that of themſelues they proue <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> For ſome thinke they might bee verified, though the ſubſtance of bread should remaine together with <hi>Chriſt's</hi> body.

And in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular that in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:2521:103"/>
the worde of Chriſt is that whereby the bread and wine is changed in to his body.

Which declare what his meaning is in thoſe words which you alleadge for the bleſſing, as if that did cauſe this change. For he as many other Fathers and Doctours call the very forme of conſecration a benediction, both becauſe they are bleſſed words appointed by <hi>Chriſt</hi> for ſoe holy an end; and becauſe they produce ſoe noble an effect, or becauſe they are ioyned alwayes with that benediction, and thanks-giuing vſed both by your B. <hi>Sauiour</hi> in the inſtitution of this holy Sacrament, and now by the <hi>Prieſts</hi> in the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> in the conſecration of the ſame.

For as much as the benediction of the <hi>Lord</hi> is not ſuperfluous or vaine, neither ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue he ſimply bread, it followeth, that when he gaue it, the tranſmutation was already made, and theſe words <hi>(this is my body)</hi> did demonſtrate what was contained in the bread, not what was made by them. Whereto I anſweare firſt; that you miſtake your termes when you call this an Opinion, which is an <hi>errour</hi> of the <hi>Graecians.</hi> Secondly I might anſweare, that this is not <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meron's</hi> authority, whom you ſeeme to cite, but doe not indeed; you citing onely for authour a <hi>french Huguenot</hi> called <hi>Daniel Chamier,</hi> who alſo citeth thoſe words out of <hi>Salmeron,</hi> but without any the leaſt mention of the place, where they may be found.

which treateth of the B. <hi>Sacrament</hi> where I thought it moſt likely to find this place but found it not. Which notwihſtanding, I will not ſay but it may bee there, for it is true that there haue beene ſome Latine authors that haue held that our <hi>Sauiour</hi> himſelfe did conſecrate not by thoſe words, but either by other words,<note place="margin">V.

                  </note> that theſe words <hi>(this is my body)</hi> wherewith <hi>Chriſt</hi> did conſecrate, are not now ſufficient to conſecrate, without certaine prayers coming after in the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Maſſe.</hi> appointed by the <hi>Church.</hi> But of this it maketh not much matter; and it may be ſome of them ſoe thinke, and therefore, I anſweare thirdly for <hi>Salmeron,</hi> this is noe opinion by him allowed (as you would ſeeme by your manner of citing him to inſinuate,) but by him condemned of errour, as your freind <hi>Chamier</hi> ſaith expreſly, citing to that purpoſe <hi>Salmeron's</hi> owne words alſo, euen there where he bringeth theſe: which you could not but ſee. Wherefore in this you come short of the very Miniſter's honeſty. How little then muſt you needs haue? Laſtly I anſweare this very authority is againſt you in the two things

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:2521:105"/>
inferre tranſubſtantiation, yet becauſe in the iudgment of ſome learned men they may haue another ſenſe which proueth onely the real preſence without tranſubſtantiation, it is not altogether improbable that without the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Church,</hi> they cannot enforce a man to beleeue <hi>tranſubſtantiation</hi> out of them. What of all this? nothing to your purpoſe Sir <hi>Knight:</hi> though in tranſlating this ſaying of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> you haue corrupted it in two places. The one, that whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaid one ſcripture, or place of ſcripture which he brought to proue <hi>tranſubſtantiation,</hi> was ſoe plaine as to enforce a man not refractory. You change the ſingular number into the plural, as if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had ſaid the Scriptures were ſoe plaine &amp;c. Which is a corruption of yours thereby inſinuating, as if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> taught the Scriptures to be plaine and with out difficulty ſoe as euery body may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, which indeed is an ordinary ſaying of you <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but as ordinarily denied by vs <hi>Catholiques.</hi> The other is, that whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith men moſt learned and acute as <hi>Scotus</hi> was. You ſay the moſt learned and acute men ſuch as <hi>Scotus.</hi> Which word <hi>(the)</hi> you cannot but know alters the ſenſe much. For it importeth as if the better part of learned and acute men went that way; which is falſe and contrary to the <hi>Cardinal's</hi> words and meaning.</p>

For thus you cite him onely. The conſecrated elements remaine in their proper ſubſtance and shape and figure leauing out all the later part of beleeuing and adoring, and all words which might ſignify any change, as there bee many. As firſt in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:2521:110"/>
that he ſaith; the myſticall ſignes doe not change their nature by Sanctification, which why should he deny, vnleſſe the Sanctification did worke ſome change: or why should he make ſuch a ſpecial matter of that, that the (myſtical ſignes that is) accidents as I shall by and by shew, should not change their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, vnleſſe the ſubſtance whereto they did belong, did change it owne nature. For it were a ridiculous thing for any man to make a wonder of that, that the colour, figure, and taſt of bread should remaine, the ſubſtance it ſelf of the bread remayning; but this being changed for them to remaine is a wonder, which may beſeeme a wiſe man to ſpeake of. Secondly whereas he ſayth theſe myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſignes may be ſeene, and touched, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you leaue that out, becauſe it plainely shewes there is ſome change; for a thing cannot bee otherwiſe then it was before, without ſome change. Now the change he ſaith is not in the accidents themſelues, or in their owne nature, for that remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, therefore it muſt neceſſarily be in that their ſubiect, as <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſpeake, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in which they did inhere, or reſt, is changed. Thirdly <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſpeaketh of ſomething which is wrought or made by ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and which is vnderſtood, and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. What is this, that is made heere? not the accidents, for they remaine the ſame, not the ſubſtance of the bread, for that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

Neither is that ſaid to bee vnderſtood or beleeued, but ſeene and felt, much leſſe is it or can it bee ſaid to bee adored. All this then you leaue out Sir <hi>Humphrey,</hi> we neede not aske you why, for euery man ſeeth the reaſon. Thus much of your mangling of this authority.</p>

Thus the obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; anſweare in the very words as they lye in <hi>Durand.</hi> Out of which firſt it is cleare, theſe men are onely <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> noe Schoole Diuines; ſuch as you pretend heere to alleadge. Though you alſoe inſinuate the ſame ſomewhat, in as much as you call them our <hi>Proctors.</hi> Wherein yet you miſtake your termes, the word <hi>Proctor</hi> being not ſoe fitt for ſoe great <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Canons</hi> as they were: for how thinke you vould your Ciuill or Canon

Doctors of the <hi>Arches</hi> take it at your hands to be called <hi>Proctors?</hi> or your great <hi>Lord Sir Edoward Cooke</hi> and Doctor as I may ſay of your common Law to be called an Attourney at Law? Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly heereby appeareth alſo your corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſaying that they taught that this opinion, was not to be reiected; for thus you putt it in a different letter. <hi>(This opinion ſay they was not to bee reiected)</hi> whereas they ſay noe ſuch thing. But onely <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand</hi> enforcing the obiection to the vtmoſt as <hi>Diuines</hi> are wont to doe the more fully to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare; taketh hold that they call it an opinion, and likewiſe taketh hold that they doe not ſay it was reproued or that it ought to be held for an error. Thirdly hence it appeareth that both they themſelues did not allow of it in that they held onely that middle opinion of <hi>tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi> for true; and that though they did not ſoe expreſly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne it of error yet it doth not follow but that it was error for they knew not all the paſſages of ſcripture: Scripture being not their ſtudy. Thus then all your <hi>Schoolemen</hi> are anſweared and conſequently this whole §. of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1.</note>

Victo.</hi> (whom hee of his owne free goodnes is pleaſed to create a <hi>Cardinal,</hi> both heere and els where, to make vp the number of his <hi>Cardinals Bishops</hi> &amp;c.) that it is called a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, becauſe the People in the primitiue Church did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate together. And he ſaith of himſelf, that it is ſoe called becauſe the Prieſt and people communicate together. After this he bringeth a <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Nantes,</hi> forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Prieſt to ſay Maſſe alone. For to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaith the <hi>Canon,</hi> doth the Prieſt ſay <hi>The Lord bee with you</hi> to which he addeth 12. or 13. of our authors in proofe that anciently the people did commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate euery day, witneſsing therein as he ſaith the antiquity of his Doctrine and intimating the nouelty of ours and he telleth vs alſo that the <hi>Councel of Trent</hi> concludeth with a well-wishing to his Doctrine, in ſaying that it
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:2521:118"/>
wisheth that the people would communicate not only ſpiritually but alſo ſacramentally, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudging his communion to be more fruitfull. This is the ſumme of this whole §</p>
               <p n="2">2. To which I anſweare, beginning with this laſt of the <hi>Councel of Trent,</hi> that the Rearder ſeeing the Man's abhominable Lying by this one thing, may giue a gueſſe of the reſt. The <hi>Councel</hi> as he confeſſeth in the beginning accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him and his Doctrine, and heere he ſaith it concludeth with a well wishing therevnto. Is it euen ſoe good <hi>Sir</hi> your Communion is allowed by the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Trent?</hi> you tell vs Newes; I pray you what <hi>Canon,</hi> what Chapter, what Seſſion is your Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion once named in? there you will ſay, where the <hi>Councel</hi> wisheth that the people that heare Maſſe would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate, not onely ſpiritually but alſo ſacramentally? is this your Communion? what? haue you <hi>Maſſe Sir Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey?</hi> take heede id may coſt you money. An informer that should heare this might catch you by the backe, and bring you in for ſoe many hundred marks, as you haue receiued bytts of bread, in your Church; Which truely might proue a deare ordinary for you. And this you muſt either confeſſe, or lett alone the <hi>Councel of Trent,</hi> which acknowledgeth noe Communion without <hi>Maſſe.</hi> For if you deny your Seruice to be Maſſe, we deny your Communion to bee Communion, for no Maſſe, noe communion: therefore bethinke your ſelfe, whither you will be content to haue a Maſſe or noe <hi>Trent-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion?</hi>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:2521:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and while you ſtand ſtudying of this, I will putt you another thing to conſider of. Which is this, that it is one thing for the <hi>Councel</hi> to wish that the people would communicate; becauſe to heare Maſſe and receiue withall would bee more profitable; another, to ſay that if there bee noe body to communicate, or that ſuch Maſſe is vnlawfull as Haeretiques ſay; the Prieſt muſt not ſay Maſſe: what thinke you <hi>Sir</hi> are not theſe two things? ſtudy the matter a while and tell vs. Doe not you then ſpeake wondrous wittily, when you ſay that there cometh bleſſing and curſing out of the ſame mouth, as if the <hi>Councel</hi> did approue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the ſame thing when it commendeth ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall communion of the people together with the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and yet condemneth not thoſe Maſſes as vnlawfull, wherein the people doe not communicate: yea approueth them? the like wit and leſſe honeſty you shew alſoe in that you ſay, that from the Confeſſion of a general Councell your Communion is concluded to bee more fruitfull; what affinity betweene your empty communion which is but a morſel of bread, and a ſupp of wine, and the true real &amp; ſubſtantiall Body and Bloud of <hi>CHRIST IESVS</hi> which the faithfull Catholique receiueth: the <hi>Councell</hi> commendeth daily receiuing of the Bleſſed Sacrament as more profitable therefore ſay you it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth your Communion which you vſe, once, twice, thrice, or 4. tymes a yeare. It wisheth that the people would receiue ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:2521:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as the <hi>Prieſt</hi> doth, you make it ſay noe; but that the <hi>Prieſt</hi> muſt doe as the people doth, that is, not celebrate but when they are diſpoſed to receiue: is it not meere madnes for you Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> thus plainely to abuſe the <hi>Councel</hi> ſoe contrary to the plaine meaning thereof?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Like to this is your folly, in alleadging ſoe many authorityes in fauour of your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as you thinke. Which whither you cite them true or noe I doe not ſtand to examine, for it maketh noe matter. They ſay it was the practize of the primitiue Church to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate euery day with the Prieſt; I grant it. What then? therefore the <hi>Prieſt</hi> now muſt ſay Maſſe but once in two or three months, or once in a twelue moneth, or not once in ſeauen yeare, vnleſſe the people be ſoe deuout as to come &amp; receiue with him? this followeth of your doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: is not this wiſe arguing? but to anſweare you another way Sir <hi>Humphrey,</hi> you cannot bee ignorant that there is not one of theſe authors which you cite for the peoples daily commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that ſaith that either it is or was of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity ſoe to doe, but onely beare witnes of the practize:<note place="margin">Bell. lib. <hi>2.</hi> de Miſ. cap. <hi>9.</hi> &amp; <hi>10.</hi> Durant. de ritib. lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>4.</hi> n. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> Whereas ſome of them as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Durantus</hi> doe proue moſt manifeſtly that there was noe ſuch neceſſity, or dependency of the <hi>Prieſt's</hi> celebrating vpon the peoples co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating, that they might not celebrate vnleſſe the people did communicate.

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:2521:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
though noe body did communicate. Doe they not proue by manifeſt authorities that in the Eaſterne Church, in the tyme of <hi>S. Ambroſe, S. Aug.</hi> &amp; <hi>S.

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:2521:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but with a mind free from deſire of ſinning, whereas hee together with other Fathers make frequent mention of dayly ſacrifice. But what is all this to your purpoſe, or to your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion? as of all that is ſaid by the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the holy Communion were meant of your ſacrilegious communion?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now for your proofes out of Scripture, as that, that <hi>our Sauiour</hi> ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>(take yee, eate yee).</hi> I anſweare that as our <hi>Sauiour</hi> there ſpake to all his Apoſtles who did all eate, ſoe out of this place a man might euen as well ſay, that all muſt communicate that are in the <hi>Church</hi> at the ſame tyme, and that the <hi>Prieſt</hi> muſt not ſay Maſſe, vnleſſe not onely one 2. or 3. communicate, but all that are there, which I doe not beleeue you will grant. For I doe not thinke that when any one man among you receiueth your communion, all receiue it. Solue this obiection then of myne, and you anſweare your owne. For <hi>S. Paul's</hi> words where he inuiteth Chriſtians to imitate him, as he did imitate <hi>Chriſt,</hi> out of which you would gather that <hi>Prieſts</hi> muſt not ſay Maſſe, vnleſſe there be ſome body to communicate, if a man should tell your Miniſters and your ſelfe too <hi>Sir Humphrey</hi> of many things which <hi>S. Paul</hi> did, and wherein hee did deſire to bee followed, as the chaſtizing of his body, his faſting and praying, his chaſtity, his labours, and the like. Both you and they would haue witt enough to find a ſolution for your ſelues,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:2521:121"/>
and would eaſily find ſomething els wherein to imitate him: neyther would you bee ſoe well able to proue your ſelues followers of him in thoſe things, as wee can doe our ſelues in this. For firſt the thing wherein <hi>S. Paul</hi> deſireth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to imitate him cannot bee the diſtributing of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which belonged onely to the office of Prieſts, whereas <hi>S. Paul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> imitation is directed to all. Secondly the thing, that he deſireth to bee imitated in,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31</note> is that which goeth next before in theſe words. <hi>Whither you eate or drinke, or doe any thing els, doe all to the glory of God. Bee without offence to Iewes and Gentils, and to the Church of God, as I pleaſe all in all things, not ſeeking what is profitable for my ſelfe, but for many that they may bee ſaued.</hi> Then come very fitly, and conſequently theſe words. <hi>Bee imitators of mee, as I alſoe of Chriſt</hi> in this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did ſeeke not his owne pleaſure but the good of many, wherein <hi>S. Paul</hi> did imitate him ſoe hee would haue the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and in them <hi>all Chriſtians</hi> to imitate him. Now that which followeth is a new matter; for he goeth from exhorting them, to praiſe them thus. <hi>I prayſe you my bretherem, that you are mindefull of mee in all things, and Keepe my praecepts as I haue deliuered vnto you.</hi> And there alſoe deliuereth a great many good praecepts of other matters, before hee come to the <hi>B. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Thirdly in this matter of Maſſe wee imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him: for our <hi>Prieſts</hi> are ready to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:2521:121"/>
ſuch as come worthily to receiue, but you muſt proue that <hi>S. Paul</hi> would not ſay Maſſe or communicate himſelf, vnleſſe others would communicate with him; or that he did teach that other <hi>Prieſts</hi> muſt not. But that you will neuer bee able to doe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That other place of ſtaying one for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, is ſpoken to the people; who made the ſuppers called <hi>agape,</hi> as is plaine by the text. Wherein he reprehends the abuſes that were committed as that ſome did exceede, others did want; ſome were drunke, ſome went away hungry which could not pertaine to the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament, as euery man knoweth beſides the diſtribution of that belonged to the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> not to the people, who are heere inſtructed and reprehended for their manner of making their ſuppers; for he ſpeaketh to the ſame people heere, that he doth in all the epiſtle, and to whom he had a little before in the beginning of the chapter giuen ſuch praecepts as noe way belong to Prieſts but are common to all. As for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple that men muſt not pray or prophecy with their hats on, and that women muſt not contrarywiſe pray or prophecy bare headed: that a man may not nourish his haire, that a woman may &amp;c. And then ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of this matter of their ſuppers, without any change of perſon: beſides that there were not many Prieſts then in that church &amp; at that tyme: For I doe not find much mention of any <hi>Bishop</hi> or <hi>Prieſt</hi> at that tyme amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the <hi>Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:2521:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but onely of <hi>Soſthenes</hi> who alſoe was with <hi>S. Paul</hi> at that tyme when he writt that epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and ioyned with him in the writing, as appeareth by the beginning, and indeede he is moſt like to haue come to <hi>S. Paul,</hi> to acquaint him with thoſe diſorders, and to deſire his authority and helpe for redreſſe of them. It is true <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpeaketh alſo imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after of the <hi>B. Sacrament</hi> which went alwaies with thoſe ſuppers which he teacheth them, with what praeparation and examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of themſelues they are to receiue, which is nothing for our purpoſe in this place.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Your laſt place of <hi>S. Paul</hi> is, where the chalice is called <hi>the cup of Communion;</hi> the reaſon of which name you ſay is becauſe the Prieſt and people muſt communicate together; or as <hi>Hugo de S. Vict.</hi> ſaith becauſe the people in the Primitiue Church, did communicate euery day. What of that which <hi>Hugo de S. Vict.</hi> ſaith? nothing to the purpoſe. For we acknowledge that this holy Sacrament is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the communion becauſe it vniteth <hi>vs to Chriſt</hi> our head, and vniteth vs among our ſelues as members of the ſame body. And though it doe this moſt perfectly, when it is alſo receiued ſacramentally, yet not onely ſoe but it doth the ſame alſoe in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, being ſpiritually receiued: and as this vnion may remaine among vs members, though euery one doe not receiue euery day, ſoe it may alſo be or remaine betweene vs
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:2521:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the Prieſt, though he ſay Maſſe and we not receiue. And if this argument of yours be good, it will follow that not onely ſome but all the people muſt receiue together with the Prieſt for if becauſe it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, the Prieſt muſt not receiue without the people, it followeth that the people alſo muſt not receiue one without another: for it hath the name of <hi>Communion</hi> as well in reguard of vniting vs one to another, as to the Prieſt, and indeede not to the Prieſt but as he is one of them. For as he is Prieſt he doth offerr it as a ſacrifice, and therein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth the people, but as he receiueth it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally or formally as a Sacrament, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee is but as one of the reſt or participateth thereof but as others doe, though his recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bee more neceſſary, in reguard of fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing the Sacrifice.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Now to come to your authority of the <hi>Councel of Nant's,</hi> (which you haue not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding inough to cite out of any original, or any good author your ſelfe, but out of <hi>Caſſander</hi> onely, beyond whom, and one or two more ſuch fellowes it ſeemeth your learning doth not ſtreatch. I anſweare that, there is ſuch a Decree cited by <hi>Bell.</hi> and others out of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> and therefore I allow of it: though it be not extant among our Councels now. I meane that decree is nor now extant in any <hi>Councel of Nants</hi> that wee haue: but the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not great, for there bee many ſuch
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:2521:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>
decrees in other Councels, which although there were ten for one, yet were it not one iott the better for you <hi>Sir</hi> for this and the like <hi>Canons</hi> ſpeake onely of not ſaying Maſſe all alone, without one or two to anſweare, and to whom the Prieſt may ſeeme to ſpeake when he ſaith <hi>Dominus vobiſcum. Our Lord with you,</hi> and the like: but what is this to ſaying Maſſe without ſome body to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with him? Where is there any one word in this <hi>Canon,</hi> or any other, any Father, any Councel, any authority of an approued au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of not ſaying Maſſe without communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants? who did euer heare that the Prieſt muſt goe firſt and aske his parishioners, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any will communicate with him, before hee will goe to Maſſe, as it is praeſcribed in your booke of common prayer published by Parliament-authority, that you muſt doe before your communion,<note place="margin">Annotat. after the order of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtringe the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> neyther will it ſerue the turne to haue one or two to beare the Miniſter company, but there muſt bee a competent number: for example ſaith your booke if the Parish conſiſt of 20. perſons, there muſt be 3. or 4. at leaſt otherwiſe the Miniſter muſt not communion it. And by this rule a man may ſay proportionably if the parish haue twenty hundred or 20000. there should be 3. or 4. thouſand to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate at once. And if a ſicke body would receiue he may not receiue alone, but hee muſt haue ſome body to beare him company,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:2521:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and not onely one or two, but many, or a competent number, as your booke ſaith, which therefore is to bee conſidered according to the number of Parishioners. This and much more may bee ſaid of the prettines of your ſeruice and good fellow communion: but heere is enough of ſuch an idle ſubiect, and ſoe hauing anſweared your third Paragraph of <hi>priuate Maſſe</hi> as you call it I come to the 4.</p>

that by queſtioning the authority of the <hi>Nicene Decrees,</hi> the authority of the whole Chriſtian faith might bee queſtioned, I ſee not why it should bee Atheiſme to ſay the ſame of the <hi>Councel of Trent.</hi> But you thinke it is Atheiſme to deny the Scriptures alone to be ſufficient?

But this of the alone ſufficiency of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is a ſeuerall matter of it ſelfe. Onely for your place of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> it is plaine you peruert it.

For the ſanctity or holyneſſe then it is manifeſt out of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> againſt you Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> that marriage among Chriſtians is an holy thing, and that it hath ſome perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>new Law</hi> inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which it had not before, both which things you deny, to belong therevnto and therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it from the number of the Sacraments, but falſely as you, ſee which is enough againſt you.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Now this ſanctity cannot conſiſt one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſignification of the coniunction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Church.</hi> For it had that from the beginning,<note place="margin">

                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:2521:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Which becauſe it is verified by the carnal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation of man and woman bound together by the band of mutual ſociety, may bee found in all marriages, though nothing ſoe perfectly as in Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> marriage. But this sheweth that ſeing this ſignification might be in other mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, the ſanctity which S. <hi>Aug.</hi> ſaith is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to our marriages, cannot conſiſt in that ſignification onely, but there muſt bee another ſanctity; and a ſanctity which may haue rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the perſons, which cannot co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſt wholy in that abſolute inſolubility which in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian marriages as <hi>Diuines</hi> ſay, is an effect of the Sacrament. For our <hi>Sauiour</hi> by his owne words <hi>Math.</hi> 19.9. sheweth that that was in ſome ſort natural and belonged to marriage euen from the very beginning of the world. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it followeth clearely out of <hi>S. Aug.</hi> that there is ſome ſanctity belonging to this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſanctifying it, in as much as pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to this coniunction of man and woman by the bond of Marriage: and heere in this ſaying of <hi>S. Aug</hi> may be noted thoſe three goods, which I ſpoke before out of S. <hi>Iſidore;</hi> and which Catholiques commonly attribute to marriage. <hi>Proles, Fides, Sacramentum.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof the former two may pertaine as S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> ſaith to other marriages: the third onely to Chriſtians. And ſoe all being cleared which you haue out of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> I come to the <hi>Schoolemen</hi> and other authors.</p>
               <p n="17">17. And firſt I begin with <hi>Beſſarion,</hi> whom
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:2521:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you will needs haue accurſed by the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> together with the <hi>Fathers.</hi> For ſaying <hi>we reade of two onely.</hi> (Or as you ſay in another pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce) <hi>of onely two Sacraments which were deliuered vs plainely in the Ghoſpel.</hi> But I muſt tell you Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> that in the alleadging or tranſlating of theſe words you are bold to vſe your ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tricks of legerdemaine, as I shall shew. <hi>Beſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarion's</hi> words in Latine as you your ſelfe cite them in the margent are theſe. <hi>Haec duo ſola Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramenta in Euangelijs manifeſtè tradita legimus. Theſe two Sacraments alone,</hi> or onely, <hi>we reade manifeſtly in ſcripture.</hi> Which is a very true ſaying: for it is nothing more but this, that we find theſe two Sacraments expreſly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, and that we find none other or none of the reſt ſoe deliuered; that is plainely. Whereas the meaning of it as you tranſlate is farre otherwiſe, to wit that there be but onely two Sacraments in all. For firſt you leaue out the demonſtratiue pronoune <hi>(haec)</hi> makeing the ſpeach more general, as if <hi>Beſſarion</hi> did ſay there were but <hi>two Sacraments;</hi> whereas he doth not ſpeake any thing that way in theſe words, of the number of Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in general; but reſtraineth his ſpeach to theſe two in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; which rather importeth, that there be other Sacraments. For if one should ſay theſe two men came this way, or theſe two horſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to mee; would not any man gather that there were more men beſides thoſe two that came this way, and more horſes beſides thoſe
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:2521:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>
two that I ſay belong to mee. For otherwiſe it were needleſſe to adde this determining or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguishing pronoune <hi>(theſe)</hi> vnleſſe, there were other things of the ſame kind, from which they are to bee diſtinguiſhed. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly the word <hi>(Sola)</hi> you place in a certaine odd and craftie manner, to make the ſentence ſound as if there were two Sacraments, and no more. For you put it before the word <hi>(Sacraments)</hi> whereof it followeth that the negation included in the word <hi>(Sola)</hi> falles vpon the word <hi>(Sacraments)</hi> as if there were but two Sacraments or two and noe more; whereas it is to fall vpon the words <hi>(expreſsè tradita) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly deliuered;</hi> that is to ſay, that theſe two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and none other are expreſly deliuered, which is another thing. Neither will it ſerue your turne to ſay, you place it in English as it is placed in the Latine: for the placing of words iuſt ſoe in English as they are in Latine may ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tymes alter, &amp; many tymes alſo make noe ſenſe at all: and in tranſlation the ſenſe is chiefly to be reguarded. Thirdly you putt in the prono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>une relatiue <hi>(which)</hi> of your ſelfe, and change the participle <hi>(tradita)</hi> in to the verbe <hi>(traduntur)</hi> whereby of one propoſition, you make two, in this manner <hi>we reade of two only Sacraments,</hi> that is of two and noe more; which <hi>two are expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered in the Ghoſpell.</hi> Whereas <hi>Beſſarion</hi> maketh but one propoſition: in which one alſoe, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is not ſoe much to affirme theſe two <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts</hi> to be expreſly deliuered, as you make it, as to deny the other <hi>Sacraments</hi> to be expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered; as shall farther appeare by his owne
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:2521:138"/>
words. Here then in this little ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of not paſt a line in length, you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitt 4. faults: beſides one which I paſſe ouer as not ſoe much altering the ſenſe. One, in leauing out <hi>(haec).</hi> Another in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in <hi>(quae).</hi> a third in changing the word <hi>(tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dita)</hi> into <hi>(traduntur)</hi> thereby making 2. propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of one. A fourth in ſoe placing <hi>(ſola)</hi> in the English, as quite to alter the ſenſe; thereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king affirmatiues of negatiues, and negatiues of affirmatiues. The leaſt of which in as much as it alteres the ſenſe, cannot be excuſed from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: eſpecially ſeeing it is by you expreſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: for you ſay that <hi>Beſſarion</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth with the Proteſtants, and for proofe you bring his words thus tranſlated, which sheweth that you intended his authority should ſound ſoe, as if there were but two Sacraments as you teach, whereby you would leade your Reader into an errour. Which yet you doe in ſuch a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, that I cannot ſay but that a wary &amp; carefull Reader, may picke out, or at leaſt gueſſe at <hi>Beſſarion's</hi> true meaning. But that is your cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning to haue a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſenſe, the one to deceiue the ſimple, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to excuſe your ſelfe againſt the obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the learned.

The reſt being nothing but ſuch foolish ſtuffe, as you are wont to talke without rime or reaſon but onely that there occurred a place of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> which you abuſe ſoe ſtrangely, as that I could not paſſe it ouer without noting. It is thus.</p>
               <p n="26">26. You ſay touching your two Sacraments they are knowne and certaine, becauſe they were primarily ordained by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> touching the other fiue, they had not that immediat inſtitution from <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Wherevpon ſay you the <hi>learned Card.</hi> noting <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the margent is forced to confeſſe. <hi>The ſacred things which the Sacraments of the new Law ſignify are threefold the grace of iuſtification; the paſsion of Chriſt, and aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. Touching Baptiſme and the Euchariſt, the thing is moſt euident concerning the other fiue it is not ſoe certaine.</hi> Soe ſay you: where in a few li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes you haue ſoe much falshood ſoe patched vp together, that a man knoweth not well what to begin with. But to begin, you ſay your two Sacraments are knowne and certaine, you meane knowne and certaine that they are Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, becauſe ordayned by <hi>Chriſt</hi> primarily, the other 5. not. And for proofe you bring the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> as if he ſaid the ſame. But in this place the <hi>Cardinal</hi> ſpeaketh not one word, eyther of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:2521:147"/>
their being or not being Sacraments, or being or not being inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> as theſe very words themſelues doe shew, and any man may ſee more plainely in <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe both heere, and elſewhere, where he handleth thoſe matters: teaching the contrary expreſly and of purpoſe. What madnes then is it for a man to ſay the <hi>Cardinal</hi> is enforced vpon a thing that he dreameth not of to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe cleane another mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Now <hi>Bellarmines</hi> meaning in that place, is onely of the ſignification of the Sacraments, that is, what thing they ſignify: becauſe they are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſignes of ſomething. And he ſaith they ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify three things, one thing paſt; to wit, the paſſion of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> another preſent, to wit, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace which they worke in our ſoules: another thing to come, to wit, aeternal life, which is the effect of grace; which three things he ſaith, euery Sacrament doth ſignify. And he ſaith it is certaine that they doe ſoe ſignify. But withall that the ſignification of theſe three is not ſoe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and alike apparent or knowne in all. But moſt apparent in <hi>Baptiſme</hi> and the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> not ſoe apparent in the reſt. Which laſt words being in Latine thus. <hi>De alijs Sacramentis non eſtita notu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Of the other Sacraments it is not ſoe knowne,</hi> (to wit that they ſignify all theſe thing;) you tranſlate or rather corrupt them thus. Of the other 5. it is not ſoe certaine. <hi>Notum,</hi> with you, is <hi>certaine.</hi> And whereas the oppoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in <hi>Bellarmines</hi> ſaying is betweene knowne and not knowne,<note place="margin">Bell. de ſacr. in gen. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>9.</hi>

which are not oppoſite. For a thing may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine though not manifeſt, as all matters of faith are. And then you leaue out that which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith of the certainty thus. <hi>Tamen cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt ſaltem implicite illa omnia ſignificare; quia cum omnia ſignificent gratiam, conſequenter etiam ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t principium &amp; finem eiuſdem gratiae.

I confeſſe that vnder one kind onely, all and whole Chriſt, and the true Sacrament is receiued.</hi> And the <hi>Decree</hi> of the <hi>Councel of Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</hi> which ſaith, that <hi>notwithſtanding Chriſt did inſtitute in both kinds yet the Laity are to communicate in one kind.</hi> Which word <hi>notwithſtanding</hi> the <hi>Knight</hi> is pleaſed to gloſſe thus. As it were in deſpite of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi> with which he ioyneth the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> ſaying thus. <hi>Although our Sauiour did exhibite in both kinds, yet if any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall ſay, the holy Catholique Church was not induced for iuſt cauſes to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the lay people, and the non-Conficient Prieſt vnder one kind to wit of bread onely, and shall ſay they er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

in ſoe doing, lett him bee accurſed.</hi> Againſt this he bringeth two places of ſcripture &amp; the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize of the primitiue Church, and ſoe concludeth the antiquity and vniuerſality of his <hi>Church.</hi> This goeth round with a fiddle Sir <hi>Humphrey.</hi> But now you muſt take vs along with you, and giue vs leaue to comin with you a little vpon the matter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This you ſay is the 6. article of our <hi>Creede:</hi> by which a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may ſee I ſaid true in the beginning, when I told you (if it had beene your good pleaſure ſoe to doe) you might haue deuided this <hi>Creede</hi> into 24. articles as well as into 12. for this is but a little libbet in the very later end of that article, as you haue put it downe in the beginning of your booke. Which peece alſo you tranſlate out of the Latine falſely, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly the Latine being thus, <hi>Fateor etiam ſub al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera ſpecie totum atque integrum Chriſtum verumque Sacramentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſumi. I confeſſe alſo vnder one kind onely to be receiued Chriſt whole and entire, and a true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi> Whereas you ſay all and whole <hi>Chriſt;</hi> as if the <hi>Councel</hi> had <hi>ſaid omnis &amp; totus Chriſtus:</hi> where the word <hi>all</hi> is improper; for who ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thus: <hi>all Peter, all Paul:</hi> and it importes as if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had many things pertaining to him, which were himſelfe; but yet did not make one and the ſame thing with him: which is not imaginable how it can be; whereas <hi>totus Chriſtus</hi> doth ſignify <hi>One whole Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>Omnis Chriſtus,</hi> and <hi>totus Chriſtus,</hi> to any man that vnderſtandeth Latine, are two wery different
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:2521:149"/>
things. And in your tranſlation you confound <hi>totus</hi> and <hi>integer;</hi> making them both to ſignify the ſame; whereas in the <hi>Councel</hi> they haue a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral ſignification; <hi>totus</hi> pertaineth to the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as conſiſting of eſſential parts of body and ſoule, and of his perſonality and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity; and <hi>integer</hi> pertaineth to the integrity of all the parts of his body, as head, hands, feete &amp;c. which the Philoſophers call <hi>partes integran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi> By this then you ſee how a man that were diſpoſed to ſtand about you might trouble you, when in ſuch a ſmall thing as this there may bee found ſoe many faults.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Conſtance</hi> which you are ſoe diſpleaſed withall, for contradicting the word of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as you conceiue; me thinkes there might be found a meanes to appeaſe your diſpleaſure, if you would but remember that at the ſame tyme, and in the ſame decree it was alſo decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that notwithſtanding that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> did inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the Bl. Sacrament after ſupper, yet men should now receiue it faſting: which decree I preſume you will not condemne. Neither will you (I dare ſay) gloſſe the words <hi>notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> ſoe fauourably in your owne behalfe, as you did in ours; as in deſpite of <hi>God</hi> and Man you would receiue your communion faſting, though <hi>Chriſt</hi> did receiue it not faſting, but euen after ſupper and bid vs doe, what hee did in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him: and notwithſtanding alſo that it is not to be doubted as you tell vs out of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:2521:149"/>
                  <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> but that is beſt &amp; fitteſt to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed which <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe hath done? Doe you not then ſee Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> how you may be made freinds with the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> ſeing it hath done you as good a turne as it hath done to vs. But becauſe I ſee not how you could but know this before, and therefore haue erred as I may well ſay wittingly this is too freindly language to talke to you, therefore I anſweare you plainely in bringing this Decree this you haue brought a ſtaffe to beate your ſelfe withal. For the <hi>non obſtante,</hi> which you would ioyne with <hi>Chriſt's</hi> inſtitution in both kinds, as if the <hi>Councel</hi> did forbid it in both kinds notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did ſoe inſtitute, is not ſoe ioyned by the <hi>Councel:</hi> but otherwiſe, thus though <hi>Chriſt</hi> did inſtitute this venerable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament after ſupper,<note place="margin">Conc. Conſt. ſeſſ. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </note> and adminiſter the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to his Diſciples vnder both kinds of bread and wine, yet this notwithſtanding the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the holy canons &amp; approued cuſtome of the Church hath obſerued, and doth obſerue, that this Sacrament is not to be conſecrated after ſupper; nor to bee receiued by the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full but faſting; Vnleſſe in caſe of infirmity or other neceſſity allowed by the law or <hi>Church.</hi> Theſe being the very words of the <hi>Councel.</hi> By which it is plaine that the <hi>Councel</hi> ſpeaketh not in this place of the inſtitution of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in one or both kinds; but onely of the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of the inſtitution thereof or manner, to wit
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:2521:150"/>
after ſupper, or not faſting, and of the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration thereof to his Diſciples in both kinds at the ſame tyme. Soe as I ſee not how you can be excuſed from a notable and wilful corruption in citing the words of the <hi>Councel</hi> often and vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeuerall occaſions thus. <hi>Though Chriſt did inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te in both kinds the Councel</hi> hauing noe ſuch word, and it being likewiſe noted by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> for a flat corruption in <hi>Luther,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">V Bell de Euch lib. <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>26.</hi>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius.</hi> Though if the <hi>Councel</hi> had ſaid ſoe, it had ſaid truely, but nothing to your purpoſe. For it is one thing to ſay that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did inſtitute the <hi>Bleſſed Sacrament</hi> vnder both kinds and another to ſay that he did inſtitute and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d all should receiue vnder both kinds. For this later is a command againſt which noe man may doe. The former is onely the Example of <hi>Chriſt</hi> which euery man is not alwaies bound to follow. And which euen you your ſelues doe not follow in the tyme and manner of your receiuing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now for vs you muſt know, this was noe new thing begunne by that <hi>Councel,</hi> (in which reſpect you might temper your choller againſt it,) but it being growne the general practice which from the beginning alſo was ſomewhat practized, and certaine Haeretiques ariſing and condemning the practize &amp; beleife of the whole Church this <hi>Councel</hi> condemned them and commanded the former cuſtome to bee ſtill retained. This is the truth of the matter againſt which I doe not ſee that you ſay a word, but onely chafe and ſay this <hi>Councel</hi> was
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:2521:150"/>
approued for ſoe much as pertaineth to the Doctrine againct Haeretiques, but not for that that pertayneth to the power of a <hi>Councel</hi> ouer a <hi>Pope.</hi> Which is all againſt your ſelfe, and sheweth you are in a vehement paſſion and know not what you ſay. But ſince you are ſoe out with this <hi>Councel</hi> which yet maketh as well for <hi>you</hi> as for <hi>vs</hi> in the point of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing faſting and not after ſupper as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did, noe wonder if you be wholy out with the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Trent:</hi> which therefore you cite in a ſtrange manner to diſgrace it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſentence as you cite it, is this. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our Sauiour did exhibite in both kinds, yet if any shall ſay the holy Catholique church was not induced for iuſt cauſes, to communicate the Lay people and the non-Conficient Prieſt vnder one kind, to wit of bread onely, and shall ſay they erred in ſoe doeing, let him be accurſed.</hi> Which ſentence is peeced out of two ſeueral places of the Councel, the former part co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained in theſe words. <hi>(Althouhg our Sauiour did exhibite in both kinds yet.)</hi> is taken out of the 3. <hi>chap. of the</hi> 21. <hi>Seſs.</hi> the later part or reſt, is the 2. <hi>canon of the ſame Seſs.</hi> which canon as it is ſet downe in the <hi>Councel</hi> hath neither a <hi>(Yet)</hi> in it, nor an <hi>(Althought):</hi> and the <hi>(Yet)</hi> in the ſaid 3. <hi>chapter</hi> inferreth another thing, thus. <hi>Though Chriſt did inſtitute and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Bl. Sacrament to his Apoſtles in both kinds, in the laſt Supper, Yet is Chriſt contained whole and entire vnder one kind, and a true Sacrament recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</hi> Which is another matter, then that which
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:2521:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded in the <hi>Canon.</hi> For in this is onely taught, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is wholy and entirely contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnder one kind: in the <hi>Canon,</hi> there is a curſe denounced againſt ſuch as shall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne the practize of communicating vnder one kind, as wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting iuſt cauſe or being erroneous. Where beſides the difference in the matter, there is great difference in the manner. The one being a plaine definition of a ſpeculatiue truth; the other being a command pertayning to practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ze, or a declaration of the Lawfulnes of the Churches practize, condemning whoſoeuer shall ſay againſt it. Soe as heere you peece two ſeuerall matters out of the Councel together without any connexion, iuſt as you are wont to doe, in your owne arguments and diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. But in this a man may ſee your ill dealing for you would faine make it ſeeme as if the Councel did decree ſomething in oppoſition to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and accurſe all ſuch as should doe as he did. But this deuice of yours, is as ſilly as it is malicious. For it is plaine to any man that shall but looke in the Councel, that there is noe ſuch matter intended or ſaid but all the contrary; for the <hi>Councel</hi> ſaith but this, in the one place. <hi>That though Chriſt did inſtitute this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in both kinds and ſoe giue it in his laſt ſupper to his Diſciples, that yet he is whole vnder each kind.</hi> Wherein I would faine ſee what oppoſition the ſubtility of your wit can find? what reaſon can you giue, why it may not ſtand with <hi>Chriſt's</hi> inſtitution in both kinds,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:2521:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that he be whole vnder both? and if whole why not alſo a true Sacrament? This is a point worthy of ſuch a witt as your to worke vpon: Soe as in this the <hi>Councel</hi> decreeth nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Noe nor in the other part neither, it being onely a defence of the Catholique Churches practice, againſt Haeretiques; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reference to <hi>Chriſt's</hi> inſtitution or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which is neither for, nor againſt that practice.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Soe as when I conſider how in this place you firſt mention Chriſt's inſtitution, and then bring the Canon of the <hi>Councel,</hi> as it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vnto it, I cannot but wonder what it is you meane, or what abſurdity it is that you would make the <hi>Councel</hi> guilty of thereby. For though the <hi>Councel</hi> should ſay thus, as it doth not. Though Chriſt did inſtitute in both kinds yet it is lawfull to receiue in one: what abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity were there in this ſoe long as <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth not command vs to receiue in both, as he did inſtitute, which you will neuer be able to proue. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> may inſtitute a thing without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding it. For example he did inſtitute Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage yet commanded not euery man to marry, ſoe he might doe alſo in his ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of inſtitution and our manner of receiuing this Sacrament. But beſides this your abuſing the <hi>Councel</hi> by patching vpp one ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce out of ſeuerall places you offend in another kind. For whereas the <hi>Councel</hi> ſaith that though <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his laſt ſupper did inſtitute the Sacrament in both kinds,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:2521:152"/>
and ſoe giue it to his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> you leaue out that of the <hi>laſt ſupper</hi> and that of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> both which were putt downe there for very good reaſons, and to our purpoſe. That deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of the tyme of the <hi>laſt ſupper</hi> leaueth it free for vs to thinke, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> might at ſome other tyme after his reſurrection, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſome of his Diſciples in one kind, as ſome <hi>Fathers</hi> thinke he did his two Diſciples at <hi>Emmaus,</hi> or at leaſt thereby did foreshew the lawfulnes of Communion in one kind, as <hi>Suarez</hi> sheweth out of <hi>S. Aug.</hi> and others.<note place="margin">Suar. <hi>3.</hi> p. to <hi>3.</hi> diſp. <hi>71</hi> ſect. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> That word <hi>of the Apoſtles</hi> is likewiſe put downe to shew that, that particular fact of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and command, did pertaine onely to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who were then ordained Prieſts; and in them to ſuch as should ſucceede them in that office; whereas you by leauing out that word, would faine haue it ſeeme as if that of both kinds did pertaine to all. Thus much then for the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Now lett vs heare what you ſay againſt this <hi>Communion in one kind.</hi> Firſt obſeruing your ſtrange folly in ſaying that one that shall heare two <hi>Councels,</hi> one accurſing, another condemning for Haeretiques, ſuch as shall deny the lawfulnes of one kind, would gladly know the reaſons: whereas you your ſelf note in the margent a treatiſe of <hi>Gerſons</hi> againſt the haereſy of the Lay communion in both kinds acknowledging that he shewes the cauſes. For if he shew cauſe why doe you call for

But to lett that paſſe with the reſt of your <hi>non ſequiturs.</hi> You bring the two places of ſcripture before cited. <hi>Drinke yee all of this: and doe this in remembrance of mee.</hi> Which places you may ſee anſweared in <hi>Bellarmine</hi> with all the enforcement and vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that <hi>Luther, Caluin, Kemnitius, Melancthon,</hi>

                  <hi>Brentius,</hi> and all the rable of them can bring: The anſweare in a word is this, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer words were ſpoken onely to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and in them to <hi>Prieſts,</hi> as appeareth more plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely by <hi>S.

                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 22 19.</note> before the conſecration of the <hi>Chalice.</hi> And though they should haue beene ſpoken after both, How will you proue to which action of <hi>our Sauiours</hi> (for he did more then one at that tyme) that pronowne <hi>(Hoc)</hi> had relation, or which it did demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate? The ſenſe therefore and explication thereof, is to be taken from the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> who vnderſtand noe ſuch precept in thoſe words, as is the giuing of both kinds.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Another argument of yours is the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Primitiue <hi>Church;</hi> for which you bring ten or eleuen authors, which needed n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> out that? that all muſt doe ſoe now? You muſt firſt proue it a practize grounded vpon ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine praecept indiſpenſable, or els it followeth not, but that it is in the power of the <hi>Church</hi> to alter the practize in the vſe and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments: as it was to change the <hi>Sabboth</hi> into the <hi>Sunday;</hi> though the obſeruing of the Sabboth were a diuine praecept; Nay you muſt proue that it was general, ſoe as none did or might doe otherwiſe; but that you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not doe. For <hi>Bellarmine</hi> euen in the place heere ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by you teacheth that euen then all did not receiue in both kinds; and heere by the way I note two things: One is that whereas <hi>Bell.</hi> in the place heere cited, ſaith he proued before, that all did not receiue in both kinds; that of the prouing you leaue out, putteing a little line, which might giue a man ſome notice of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting; which yet is a litle better dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, then commonly you vſe, though not ſoe good as you promiſed vs at firſt. Another that whereas <hi>Bell.</hi> bringeth ſix maine reaſons dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out of ſcriptures, partly out of the figures of the old teſtament, and partly out of the doctrine and examples of our <hi>Sauiour</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in the new; and in one of thoſe reaſons which is deduced out of the practize of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue <hi>Church,</hi> he bringeth ſix ſeueral rites or practices, which our aduerſaryes cannot deny, euidently conuincing the frequent vſe of one kind, you in your 7. Sect. heere before bring but
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:2521:153"/>
one coniectural place (which I there promiſed to anſweare) as if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had noe more, nor noe better proofs: euen which coniecture you neither doe nor can impugne. For it is grounded vpon two places of ſcripture, thus <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith <hi>it is a probable coniecture that the Nazarites among the firſt Chriſtians in Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem did communicate in one kind:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bell. lib. <hi>4.</hi> de Euch. cap. <hi>24.</hi>
                  </note> He proueth it thus one ſcripture ſaith of theſe firſt Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians in Hieruſalem, <hi>that they were all perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering in the doctrine of the Apoſtles, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of bread, which is the receiuing of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt as all agree.</hi> Among theſe, there were many <hi>Nazarites,</hi> as it is moſt probable, for there were many continually among the <hi>Iewes.</hi> Which being ſoe, there was another ſcripture that did forbid a <hi>Nazarite</hi> to drinke wine, or euen eate a grape, raiſin, or ſoe much as the ſtone; it was not like then that they did receiue in both kinds. For either they muſt make the former ſcripture falſe, if they did not communicate at all; or they muſt breake the command of the later, by communicating in both kinds. This <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth not ſay is a conuincing proofe, for ſuch he hath a great many others; but onely probable and ſuch noe man can deny it to bee. Why then should you ſtand geering at it, without once ſaying what is falſe or improbable.</p>

practiſe of the Primitiue church for the Layty to communicate in both kinds, I allow of their authority they affirming onely that it was the practiſe, not any command. But for as much as you bring one authority to proue the more conueniency of Communion in both kinds quite contrary to the author's meaning, I meane heere to haue a ſaying vnto you for it: this author is <hi>Ruardus Tapperus</hi> whom you cite thus. <hi>It were more conuenient the communion were adminiſtred vnder both kinds, then vnder one alone, for this were more agreeable to the inſtitution, and fulneſſe thereof; and to the example of Chriſt, and the Fathers of the Primitiue church;</hi>

               <p n="1">1. In this §. the <hi>Knight</hi> ſpeaketh againſt the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe and doctrine of the Catholique Church in two things.

The practice of which two things (though the <hi>Knight</hi> confound them into one) was ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and diſtinctly approued by the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> &amp; <hi>anathema</hi> pronounced againſt whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer should condemne either of them. Againſt which notwithſtanding he beginneth with the <hi>Councel's</hi> owne authority, thinking alſo euen by it to make good the contrary practiſe of his Church. For ſaith hee, the <hi>Councel</hi> in ſaying that the Maſſe doth containe great inſtruction of the faithfull people, or as he tranſlateth the words of the <hi>Councel</hi> in the beginning of this §. <hi>great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction for the common people.</hi> And that it is to be interpreted vnto them, doth conſequently affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me that the ſeruice and prayer in the reformed Churches in the vulgar tongue, was better for the aedification of the Church: and this he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes with an argument of his owne thus. And without doubt (ſaith hee) the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to shew forth the Lord's death till his coming, it was not intended to shew it to the walls, or in a ſilent &amp; vnknowne voyce, as it is

now vſed in the Romane Church, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it openly to bee heard and vnderſtood of the hearers. Soe farre our <hi>Knight.</hi> Now to reckon with him.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

Thirdly, the vſe of vulgar tongues in the Maſſe and Church-office would cauſe not onely great confuſion but breed an infinite number of errours by ſoe many ſeueral tranſlations, not onely in ſeueral countries, but by ſeueral tranſlations in euery countrey of any ſmall extent, euen in the ſame place vpon a litle change of tyme: for as we ſee in euery age the vulgar language reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a great alternation; of which tranſlations
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:2521:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <hi>Church</hi> would not be able any way to iudge, ſcripture being the hardeſt thing to tranſlate of all other, &amp; which therefore for the well tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereof, requireth the ſpecial aſſiſtance of the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> which noe priuate man can promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe himſelfe. Laſtly the vſe of a vulgar language in ſuch things, would breede a great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of ſacred things, with prophanes and irreligioſity; beſids the daunger of haereſy, which cometh noe way ſooner, then by miſ-vnderſtanding of holy ſcripture. Neither are any more apt to miſ-vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it, then the ſimpler ſort of people if they once take vpon them to vnderſtand. Theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons then among others, but moſt of all the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church, drawne euen from the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> by perpetual Succeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and practiſe, might perſwade the <hi>Councel</hi> to thinke that though ſome benefitt might come to ſome few particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men by vnderſtanding what is written, yet it was abſolutely better to retaine the ſame cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſtill: and euen to remedy that inconuenience another way, to wit, by explaning ſomething of what is read in the Maſſe, which the <hi>Councel</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth by a ſimilitude very proper for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to wit, by breaking of bread to little ones: fort it is euen as neceſſary for ordinary people to haue the Scriptures ſoe declared, as for children to haue their bread broken, and as vnfit to giue ſuch men the Scripture it ſelf whole to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, or to reade it ſoe vnto them, as to giue a little child a whole great loafe. Neither if a man marke the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Trent's</hi> words
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:2521:160"/>
well, doth it ſay that the Maſſe doth containe inſtruction in that ſenſe, as if the only reading of things in the vulgar language would bee an inſtruction, but onely that it containeth great inſtruction, that is many things, which might be good for the people to learne being explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which a man might truely ſay, though euen when it is in the vulgar language it cannot be vnderſtood without helpe of an expoſitor, how then Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> doth the Councel acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge your practize, to be more for aedification of the people. Nay doth it not in the Canon expreſly condemne it? ſaying <hi>anathema</hi> to who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer shall condemne the practize of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church</hi> in reading ſome part of the <hi>Canon</hi> ſoftly, or to whoſoeuer shall ſay that the <hi>Maſſe</hi> ought to be celebrated in the vulgar tongue?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now for the place of Scripture which you bring, to wit, that <hi>wee muſt shew forth the Lord's death, till his Coming;</hi> which you ſay is not intended to the walls, as we doe, it sheweth ſufficiently how well you vnderſtand Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re; and conſequently how well the common people, betweene whom and your ſelf, you I dare ſay thinke there is a great deale of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, would vnderſtand them, when you being euen a writer ſoe little vnderſtand them. For that place of announcing our <hi>Lord's</hi> death, is not vnderſtood by words, as you vnderſtand it, but by deeds, as it is moſt plaine by the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wherein they were ſpoken, to wit, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating and changing the bread and wine
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:2521:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>
into the body and bloud of our <hi>Lord;</hi> as we doe daily in the Maſſe, in memory of our Sauiours paſſion. For ſoe S. Paul, hauing ſpoken of the inſtitution and manner to be obſerued in the conſecration expreſly ſaith, <hi>as often as you shall doe this, you shall announce the death of our Lord.</hi> The doing therefore is the <hi>announcing,</hi> not the <hi>Saving.</hi> Beſides theſe words, at leaſt in the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of ſpeaking, doe not import any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand: For you shall find the word <hi>annuntiabitis</hi> is the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catiue moode, and future te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe, if you looke well into your Accidence Sir <hi>Humphrey.</hi> And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all it is ſomewhat conditional, to wit, that <hi>as often as we shall doe that, we shall announce the death of our Lord.</hi> Beſides Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> I neuer heard before, that it was, all one to ſpeake La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and to ſpeake to the walls: if a man should ſpeake a word of Latine to you, were that to speake to a wall? You ſee then you doe not marke what you ſay.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But now you haue ſpoken ſoe well of your ſelfe, lett vs heare what you can ſay out of other men. And firſt for <hi>Haymo,</hi> whom you cite for your purpoſe, asking this vnanſwearable queſtion as you call it. If a man that knoweth onely his Mother's tongue ſtand by, or make a Sermon, or giue a Bleſſing, how shall hee ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> ſince he doth not know what thou ſaiſt? Soe you. To which I anſweare, it is true, <hi>Haymo</hi> hath a queſtion to this purpoſe, but not ſoe much to yours, if you marke him well, nor ſoe vnanſwearable, if you take him altogeather, with what he ſaith before and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:2521:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>
after your queſtion.

For which truely, there doth not neede any ſuch great vnderſtanding of Latine. Soe that though <hi>Haymo</hi> thinke, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in that place of the publique prayers of the Church offered by the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> as ſome few other Doctors doe, though not ſoe rightly nor ſoe conformably to the true intent and drift of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> yet he requireth noe more but that there be one to anſweare <hi>Amen;</hi> which ſurely may be more eaſily had, then for want thereof to be faine to change the whole office of the Church in to English. And ſoe <hi>Haymo</hi> his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwearable queſtion is without any ſuch great adoe anſweared. Now for S. <hi>Paules</hi> meaning, though your obiection require it not and that it require alſo a longer diſputation, yet not to leaue the Reader wholy vnſatisfied thereof, I ſay in a word that <hi>S.

which they it ſeemes grew prowd of, and vſed for oſtentation. For correcting of which abuſe the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> writeth heere vnto them preferring Prophecy, that is exhortation before tongues, and giuing many reaſons therefore: among which this is one, that others that heare that prayer in a ſtrange Language, are not the better, nor can ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to it.

For if this decree had concerned the Latine Church any way, it should haue beene put in practiſe in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce thereof, and moſt of all in <hi>Italy,</hi> in the <hi>Popes</hi> ſight, but there is noe ſigne of any ſuch thing, but plaine proofe to the contrary. Which anſweare is cleare and ſolide. But beſides this anſweare of <hi>Bellarmines,</hi> a man may anſweare alſo, that the <hi>Councel</hi> ſpeaketh of two things heere, to wit, of celebrating the diuine offices, and adminiſtring Sacraments, and then putteth two things more anſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnto thoſe two, to wit, rites and langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, rites anſwearing to diuine offices, and languages to Sacraments, as if it had ſaid, let ſuch <hi>Bishops</hi> prouide men who may celebrate the deuine offices according to the diuerſity of their rites, and adminiſter the Sacraments according to the diuerſity of their languages.

To which I anſweare that it is true, as theſe authors ſay, that in the beginning it was ſoe: but what thinke you was the reaſon? euen becauſe thoſe three holy Languages <hi>Hebrew, Greeke,</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> were moſt vulgar, and common: the <hi>Hebrew</hi> in <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> and the parts adioyning, the <hi>Greeke</hi> in <hi>Greece</hi> where <hi>S.

the diuine Myſteries in other language, then that wherein they were ordinarily had and read, to wit, in ſome one of thoſe languages. Of later ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes we confeſſe there hath beene vſe of other languages, as <hi>Arabick, Chaldaick,</hi> and the like, but yet ſoe as that the Church hath euer made choyce of ſome one language which hath beene very common to many kingdomes and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; not proper to any particular prouince or country.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And heere it is to be noted further, for anſweare of your authorityes in this point Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> that whereas ſome of our authors are of opinion, that S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in that 14. Chap. of the 1. to Corinth. where he ſpeaketh of prayers in a knowne tongue is to be vnderſtood of the publique prayers of the Church that explication is contradicted by moſt of our other authours; and there be many reaſons out of the very text and circumſtances againſt it; as namely that the men which are heere reprehended for their oſtentation of languages are the <hi>People</hi> not the <hi>Prieſts:</hi> as appeareth by the whole epiſtle, as I noted heere before §. 3. <hi>n.</hi> 5. vpon another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; as alſo becauſe this pertaineth to women alſo, who it ſeemeth did vſe to ſpeake among the reſt, which <hi>S. Paul,</hi> therefore reprehendeth as an abuſe and forbiddeth. Thirdly <hi>S. Paul,</hi> ſpeaketh of the infidells coming in and being preſent at thoſe their meetings and conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Which therefore could not bee of the <hi>Church</hi> office and Sacrifice of the Maſſe to
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:2521:165"/>
which <hi>Infidells</hi> were not admitted. Wherefore it cannot be of the publique prayers of the Church which belonged onely to <hi>Prieſts</hi> to make publiquely for others in the Church: But though it were ſoe and that ſome doe put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to more ſtraits then they neede, in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting S. <hi>Paul,</hi> of publique prayers, yet doth it not auaile you Sir <hi>Humphrey.</hi> For euen thoſe men giue a reaſon of difference, why now it needeth not; to wit becauſe now as <hi>S. Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine,</hi> ſaith, People are ſufficiently acquainted with the eccleſiaſtical rites, and men know very well what is done by being preſent, and ſeing, though they doe not vnderſtand the particular epiſtles and Ghoſpels, which are ſeueral according to the Sundayes and holy dayes; but the reſt of the Maſſe being the ſame continually they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it ſufficiently for exerciſe of their deuotion, though not to ſatisfy the vaine curioſity of ſuch people, as you breed vp in the pride of an hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſpirit, to beleeue nothing but what they ſee, and contemning whatſoeuer they doe not ſee or vnderſtand: our people know ſufficiently, what the <hi>Prieſt</hi> meaneth by turning to them &amp; ſaying <hi>Dominus Vobiſcum, Oremus, Orate Fratres,</hi> and the like; I ſay ſufficiently to lift vpp their minds to Almyghty God, to ioyne in their harts &amp; minds with the <hi>Prieſts</hi> in that prayer, which he maketh publique for them, as well as any learned Clar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke that vnderſtandeth the English of the words.

But now becauſe you ſay this prayer in the vulgar tongue was vſed by the praecept of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and practiſe of the ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> I would know of you, where this precept is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, either in ſcripture, or out of ſcripture, in any author of credit? I doe not find ſoe much as any shaddow of a praecept in ſcripture. S. <hi>Paul</hi> in that epiſtle to the Corinthians which your men for the moſt part ſtand vpon, doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne that Prayer in an vnknowne tongue, as you doe; for he both ſaith it is good, though he preferre the guift of Prophecy before it: and alſo he alloweth the vſe of it, but wishing withall that ſome other should interpret it; as you ſee the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> wisheth Paſtours and Curats to doe of the Maſſe, and myſteries therein contained. Where then is the precept commanding a knowne tongue or forbidding an vnknowne tongue? and this I ſay ſuppoſing for diſputations ſake two things, which are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them ſoe: to wit, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> there ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of publique prayer of the Church-office; and that the Latine Greeke or Hebrew tongues are rightly called vnknowne tongues, or any way comprehended vnder that appellation in S. <hi>Paul.</hi>

Whereto I anſweare noe ſuch matter: for firſt they ſpeake not a word of any praecept. Secondly ſome witneſſe only the practiſe of that tyme yet withall giuing the reaſon why it neede not be ſoe now: others ſpeake nothing that way: for example <hi>Io. Bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi> euen as you cite him ſaith onely that in the Primitiue Church noe man was to ſpeake in tongues vnleſſe ſome body were to interprete; from whence he ſaith is growne our cuſtome when the Ghoſpell is read to expound it: which is quite againſt you; for he acknowledgeth ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of languages which you deny, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding, which according to you will not be needfull.

                  <hi>It is to bee ſaid that it may be that in the Primitiue Church Benedictions were vſed in the vulgar lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:</hi> whom yet you make to ſpeake abſolutely and certainely. Thirdly though ſome ſay the prayers of the Church were vſed in a language vnderſtood by the people yet noe man ſaith that, that language was any of the ordinary vulgar languages or indeede other then <hi>Hebrew Greek or Latine.</hi> Wherefore all the authors you can bring though you should bring ten for one in this manner will nothing auaile you.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Now for your citation and tranſlation of ſuch authours as you bring I could find many faults but I paſſe them ouer onely <hi>Bellarmine</hi> I cannot lett paſſe becauſe you abuſe him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more groſly; for you bring an obiection of his out of one place, and an anſweare out of another there being noe connexion or correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence betweene the anſweare and obiection as you make it, thus. It may be obiected, ſay you out of him, that in the tyme of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> all the people in diuine ſeruice did anſweare one <hi>Amen.</hi> And this cuſtome continued long in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> Churches, as appeare, &amp;c. Which is true, but nothing to the preſent purpoſe: for men may anſweare <hi>Amen,</hi> to the publique prayers of the Church without their being in a vulgar language. Neither is it the thing which, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> obiecteth againſt and anſweareth: but he hauing proued that thoſe prayers and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual canticles which the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> would haue to be made in the Church in the vulgar tongue,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:2521:167"/>
that the people might vnderſtand &amp; anſweare, <hi>Amen,</hi> were not the publique prayers of the <hi>Church</hi> but priuate exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porary deuotions though in the <hi>Church</hi> with others: he obiecteth in behalf of an Haeretique thus; you will ſay that as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> would haue thoſe prayers to bee made in a vulgar tongue, to the end the people might anſware <hi>Amen,</hi> ſoe he ought in like ſort to wish, that the diuine Office might be celebrated in the vulgar tongue, that the people might anſweare, <hi>Amen.</hi> To this hee anſweareth denying the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence: becauſe the diuine Office was celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in Greeke, which was vnderſtood by many though perhaps not by all, and this was enough, for the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> did not deſire that all should anſweare, whereas the other languages which they ſpoke by the guift of tongues, were ſuch many tymes, as not one man there vnderſtood them, not euen the ſpeaker himſelf: and this was <hi>Bell.</hi> Firſt anſweare which you leaped ouer Sir <hi>Humphrey,</hi>

                  </note> becauſe you ſaw it was a good and proper for our caſe: for it is the ſame of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine and their Greeke; for though all doe not vnderſtand Latine yet many doe and almoſt euery body enough to anſweare, <hi>Amen.

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:2521:168"/>

Now in Englishing <hi>Bellarmines</hi> words beſids other ſmaller faults, you haue theſe two, which I note. You ſay the office of publique ſeruice was diuided: whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith not ſoe, but that offices were more diuided, that is, the ſeueral functions in the Church, to wit, that which belonged to Prieſts and Clarks was left to them, and that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the people was left to the people or they to it: for to them it did not ſoe properly belong to ſing and anſweare, but onely for that tyme of neceſſity, when the number both of Clarks and people was but ſmall, the other fault is, that you tranſlate <hi>Solis Clericis: onely to the Church:</hi> whereas it is <hi>to the Clarcks alone,</hi> or <hi>by themſelues:</hi> which though it may be the ſame in ſenſe, I ſee not why you should take that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to alter at you pleaſure in the tranſlations of other men's words? And ſoe much for your authors.</p>

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:2521:168"/>
becauſe in the primitiue tymes ſay you the Canon of the Maſſe was publiquely read and vnderſtood of all,<note place="margin">Io Beleth. de diu. offi. cap. <hi>44.</hi>
                  </note> and pronouncing the words of conſecration ouer their bread and wine in the fields, the bread and wine were ſuddainly tranſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiated into flesh and bloud; and themſelues ſtrucken dead by the hand of God. Wherevpon you ſay that by <hi>Honorius</hi> his confeſſion the canon of the Maſſe was anciently read alowd, and which is ſtrange ſay you, alſo, that Shepheards did tranſubſtantiate bread and wine, by which you tell vs farther, it ſeemeth the alteration of the Church ſeruice into the Latine and vnknowne tongue was occaſioned: the ſame ſtory you ſay is told by <hi>Innoc.</hi> 3. and <hi>Io. Belethus:</hi> adding a reaſon withall out of them why the words of conſecration are pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſecretly, to wit, <hi>ne Sacroſancta verba vileſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Leaſt the holy words should grow contemptible.</hi> Thus you talke freely Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> as if all were Ghoſpel you ſay.</p>
               <p n="14">14. But you muſt giue other men for all that, a little leaue to make doubt thereof: and firſt you runne heere from one thing to another, to wit, from ſeruice in a knowne or vnknowne ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, to ſoft or lowd pronouncing of the words of conſecration, or of the Canon of the Maſſe. Secondly you ſay that by occaſion of this Story which you tell vs, the Church altered the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in to the Latine, and vnknowne tongue: wherein Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> you forgett your ſelf much: for you told vs before that, that alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

was brought in by Pope <hi>Vitalian,</hi> about the yeare. 666. which cannot well agree with this ſtory of yours: for if it were a late ſtory neere <hi>Honorius</hi> his tyme, that relateth it, that was neere 500. yeares after <hi>Vitalian's</hi> tyme, if the ſtory be an ancient one as there is one ſome what like, which I shall by and by ſpeake of, in the booke called <hi>Pratum ſpirituale</hi> then that was a good while before <hi>Vitalian's</hi> tyme: for the man that writeth it liued in <hi>Honorius,</hi> 1. his tyme which was the 6. Pope before <hi>Vitalian,</hi> and that author writeth it by the relation of a graue ancient man who knew one of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that were actours in this buſines, now an old man, the thing hauing happened when hee was but a boy, ſoe that there might very well bee 80. or 100. yeares betweene the tyme of this ſtory and Pope <hi>Vitalian.</hi> Thirdly I ſee not why this ſtory should cauſe ſoe great an alteration, as to change the Church-Office or Maſſe into another tongue: for it might haue ſerued the turne very well to reade the Canon or ſpeake the words of conſecration ſoftly, that others might not heare or learne them. Or if they muſt be cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged into an other tongue, not to be knowne, why into Latine the moſt knowne tongue in the whole world: beſids where this thing hapned the Church-language was Greeke, which was not ſoe common to the vulgar, which if it did not hinder the irreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence committed there, how should it be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely that changing it into Latine onely would
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:2521:169"/>
hinder it heere? Moreouer if it did not cauſe any change in the Eaſterne Church where it hapned, why should it cauſe any in the Weſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Church where perhaps this ſtory was not heard of for a long tyme after? And indeede lett the language be what it will, any man may learne ſome few words and abuſe them if he will, therefore that will helpe little. Laſtly me thinks it had beene meete for you Sir <hi>Humphrey,</hi> to haue ſaid ſomewhat when this change was made, or what language it was that was vſed before: or bring ſome author for your ſelf; for of theſe 3. which you ſay mention the ſtory, there is not one that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth any mention of changing the Church-Office into Latine vpon it, but onely they alleadge it by occaſion of the ſecret reading of the Canon of the Maſſe, which was the thing they had in hand.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Now for the ſtory it ſelf you cannot but know that it is anſweared by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> it being obiected formerly by <hi>Kemnitius:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bell lib. <hi>2.</hi> de Miſs. cap. <hi>12</hi>
                  </note> his anſweare then is, that there is ſuch a ſtory related by good authority in <hi>Pratum ſpirituale:</hi> but there, neither the bread nor wine were tranſubſtantiated but conſumed by fire from heauen; nor the shepheards ſtrucken dead; but onely layd for dead 24. howers; after which they came to themſelues againe, which is neither im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible nor improbable. Now for theſe three authours, that you cite, none of them doth rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te it out of any author or with any ſpecial credit,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:2521:170"/>
but onely out of a report which they expreſſe by the word <hi>Fertur</hi> and therefore ſome of them as <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Belethus,</hi> might be miſtaken in ſome of the circumſtance, though <hi>Innocentius</hi> be not:<note place="margin">Innoc. <hi>3</hi> lib. <hi>3.</hi> de Miſs. cap. <hi>1.</hi>

Now this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as the ſtory doth not make any way againſt vs, for we grant that the words were anciently pronounced alowd in ſome place; Soe it maketh againſt you, who deny that any whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re they were ſpoken ſoftly: for the author of this ſtory giuing a reaſon, how the boyes came to learne the words ſaith thus.<note place="margin">Prat.

               <p n="1">1. This 7. §. of Image-worshipp our <hi>Knight</hi> beginneth after his ordinary manner with an article as he calleth it of our <hi>Romane Creede,</hi> wherein we profeſſe that the Images of <hi>Chriſt, our Lady,</hi> and the <hi>Saints</hi> are to be had and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and that dew honor and Veneration is to be yeilded vnto them; and then bringeth the Decree of the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Seſs.</hi> 25.</note> for the ſame point, in theſe words. We <hi>teach that the images of Chriſt the Virgin mother of God, and other Saints, are cheifly in Churches to be had and retained, and that dew honour and worshipp is to be giuen them.</hi> Which Decree he might haue tranſlated a little better, and more clearely, by ſaying that thoſe images are to be had and retained eſpecially in Churches: the Latine word being <hi>(praeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim)</hi> and his tranſlating thereof <hi>chiefly</hi> and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it ſoe oddly, giueth cauſe to thinke he had an euill meaning therein, as if he would haue his Reader thinke that the <hi>Councel</hi> taught that theſe Images were the chiefe things to bee had in Churches, which is not the <hi>Councel's</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as is plaine the words being very cleare in Latine. But this is but a note by the way not as a thing that I ſtand vpon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This our Doctrine of image-worship he doth abſolutely deny and condemne, as a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and blaſphemous opinion: firſt becauſe it not onely wants authority of ſcripture, (which
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:2521:171" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he ſaith an article of faith ought to haue) but becauſe the ſcripture doth flatly and plainely forbid it: and in the margent citeth <hi>Leuit.</hi> 26. <hi>Ex.</hi> 20. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. <hi>Eſay.</hi> 40. This cenſure is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mewhat deepe Sir <hi>Humphrey,</hi> vpon ſuch ſleight ground, becauſe forſooth we haue noe proofe of ſcripture; for though you thinke it neceſſary to haue expreſſe proofe of ſcripture to make a matter of faith, yet as I ſaid before you are much miſtaken; wherefore you ought not to ſtand ſtill vrging it in ſuch manner as if it were a certaine and vndoubted principle; yet this I graunt you that though expreſſe Scripture be not neceſſary to make a matter of faith, yet if you haue expreſſe ſcripture againſt it, it is true, it can be noe matter of faith: but by your leaue none of thoſe places which you note, make any mention of image-worship but idol-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship which you cannot but know to be a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thing hauing beene ſoe often told it, as you haue beene by vs: therefore your firſt proofe fayling all failleth, for though you put a <hi>Firſt,</hi> yet I ſee noe <hi>ſecond.</hi> and ſoe much for that.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But becauſe heere had beene an end too ſoone of ſoe good a matter: you tell vs <hi>Vazq.</hi> ſaith, all images were forbidden ſoe farr forth as they were dedicated to adoration, and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Agrippa,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Iewes,</hi> did abhorr no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then images: to the ſame purpoſe you alleadge <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Iew,</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> of thoſe tymes: and Sir <hi>Edwin ſands</hi> of the <hi>Iewes</hi> that are now adayes. Wherevpon
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:2521:171" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you conclude that it is agreed vpon on both ſides that the <hi>Iewes,</hi> neuer allowed adoration of images for 4000. yeares and from thence you deſcend to the new Teſtament wherein you ſay the ſame law remayneth, becauſe it was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; for though ſome <hi>Catholiques,</hi> teach that it was a poſitiue caeremonial law, yet others ſay it was natural; and for that you alleadge <hi>Bellar.</hi> wherefore the law being not abrogated, you would haue ſome exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple or precept in the Ghoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel for adoration: of which you ſay, Mr. <hi>Fisher,</hi> acknowledgeth there is not any expreſſe, but that there be principles, which the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſuppoſed, conuince adoration to be lawful. Soe as from the light of nature ſay you, an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of faith muſt be declared. Well this is your diſcourſe Sir <hi>Humphrey,</hi> which in a word is but this. The <hi>Iewes</hi> might not haue nor adore images, <hi>ergo,</hi> we may not. For aſweare whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof I might ſay in like ſort the <hi>Iewes</hi> might not eate bloud nor ſwines flesh nor many other things <hi>ergo,</hi> we may not: but becauſe you may ſay theſe precepts are caeremonial &amp; therefore not now in force the other natural &amp; therefore in force, for the preſent, I will onely make this argument to shew the connexion of your antecedent and conſequent: the <hi>Iewes</hi> might not make any ſimilitude or likeneſſe of any thing in heauen or earth to adore it for a God, <hi>ergo,</hi> we may not make or haue the images of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and Saints to reuerence and honour them, as the pictures of Saints onely, and not Gods:
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:2521:172" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is not heere a good and a ſubſtantiall argument trow you? and yet it is yours Sir <hi>Humphrey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. But ſay you there was ſuch a command of not making any images in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is ſtill. True: I graunt there was ſuch a command then, but whether it be ſtill in force or noe or how farr it is in force there is the queſtion: for reſoluing whereof it is to be conſidered that there be two opinions among our Diuines as you take notice; of which ſome ſay it is moral: others caeremonial: &amp; according to both I anſweare you two wayes; one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Vazq.</hi> and his authours: who ſay that there was ſuch a commaund indeede but that it was but for that tyme onely, and is now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired being but temporall and caeremonial, made and obſerued then in reguard of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the <hi>Iewes</hi> to idolatry. Which if it were not ſoe then, but that it were yet in force as you would haue it, then could not you how haue your wiues picture nor she yours without breach of that command: therefore in that ſenſe you cannot vrge it more againſt our pictures then we againſt yours. Neither can you ſaue your ſelfe by ſaying that your pictures are not dedicated to adoration as ours are. For in <hi>Vazq.</hi> his ſenſe they are euery iott as much: as is plaine by his very words which are theſe that follow.<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:2521:172"/>
when a Picture is painted or carued by it ſelfe not as an appe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dix or addition to another thing by way of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</hi> By which rule your pictures are in ſtate of adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or ſo that they may be adored becauſe they are whole and compleate pictures of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, not additions, ornaments or appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ioyned or belonging to another thing: as the Cherubins in the temple were, which he ſaith therefore were not in ſtate to be adored becauſe they were not there as compleate of themſelues, but onely by way of appendix or appurtenance for ornament of the arke: for hence he inferreth, that all manner of pictures were forbidden euen out of the Temple: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore euen in <hi>Vazq.</hi> his opinion whoſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity you alleage you muſt acknowledge this commandement to be onely caeremonial, and but for that tyme of the old law. For by it in this ſenſe all making or hauing any image or picture whatſoeuer was forbidden, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely is not now in force and ſoe not againſt vs any way.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now according to the other opinion alſo I may anſweare that the praecept was moral; and therefore doth bind ſtill, but that by it were not forbidden all images, but ſuch as were made to repreſent falſe <hi>Gods,</hi> and were to be ſoe adored: and that therefore it is noe diſtinct praecept or commandment but onely an explication of the firſt of the ten commaundements which is that we should haue noe other Gods but him; to wit, that we should not make a God to our ſelues of
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:2521:173"/>
anie thing els, either in heauen or earth, making any Idol or likeneſſe of any of all thoſe things to adore it. So that whether with <hi>Vazq.</hi> we deny the very making or hauing of pictures or whether with <hi>Bell.</hi> we allow the making and hauing them &amp; deny onely the adoring them with diuine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the diuerſity of opinions helpeth you not one whit. Both ſtanding very well with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique faith and both againſt yours: for euen <hi>Vazq.</hi> though he deny the making of pictures and conſequently all adoration of them yet he graunteth and proueth euen out of the old teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that honour and reuerence might and was giuen to things inſenſible and as little deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing reuerence in themſelues as pictures ſoe it were with reference to almighty God: as for example the arke and Temple vnderſtanding that place of the Pſalme <hi>adorabimus in loco vbi ſteterunt pedes eius,</hi>

it be moral, as you would haue it, what are you the better? Doth <hi>Chriſt</hi> or his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſay ſoe, or is this the order that they haue taken? if it bee not, you are neuer the neerer?

               <p n="17">17. For <hi>Pereſius;</hi> his words are nothing againſt vs, for they touch onely vpon a ſchoole point whether the picture be to be adored with the ſame worship as the prototype or thing repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, or with an inferiour worship: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer opinion onely he denieth, becauſe ſaith he there is neither proofe out of ſcripture, tradition of the Church, common conſent of Fathers, or determination of a general Councel? which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſaying of his is enough to condemne you, who will not acknowledge ſufficient authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in tradition, Fathers, or Councel to belieue a thing which you like not. But to make it plainely appeare how much you wrong <hi>Pereſius</hi> in bringing him againſt the worship of images I will bring a place 2. leaues before that which you cite out of him it is this. <hi>Manifeſte habes,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Peres. de tradit. cap. de imag.</note> It is manifeſt that the vſe and worſhip of images hath beene vniuerſally in the Church from the tyme of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and that the diſ-eſteeme of them began from forlorne and infamous men 500. yeares after the Church was planted: and truely if the worship and reuerence be done de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly and ſincerely, this inſtitution is holy and profitable, which both Apoſtolique tradition hath introduced, the vſe of the vniuerſal Church affirmed, the conſent of very famous and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels both in the Eaſt and Weſt being added thereto: which alſo euen natural reaſon doth dictate.

Now for <hi>Agobardus</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ſeeme to make great acount of, if you conſider him a little, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you will find little cauſe: he writeth indeede a booke <hi>de picturis &amp; imaginibus,</hi> the whole drift whereof is onely againſt the idolatrical vſe or abuſe of images, againſt which he ſpeaketh very much by occaſion of ſome abuſes in his tyme as it is meete hee and euery good man should. And for the ſame end, he bringeth many au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorityes of the ancient Fathers all which ſpeake plainely againſt idolatry: and likewiſe he bringeth that canon of the <hi>Councel of Eliberis</hi> which you bring out of him, that noe picture should be painted on the walls, vnderſtanding it in the ſame ſenſe which I alleadged in my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond anſweare to that Canon before, to wit, for auoyding ſuperſtition in ſome young and vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Chriſtians, conuerted from gentility. But for thoſe words which follow in your cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, to wit, theſe. <hi>There is noe example in all the ſcriptures or Fathers, for adoration of images:</hi> I doe not find them in him: this I am ſure of, that they are not ioyned with the former as you heere ioyne them. Thus indeede he ſaith in a certaine place: <hi>habuerunt antiqui Sanctorum imagines vel pictas vel ſculptas ſed cauſa hiſtoriae ad recordandum non ad colendum. The ancients had the pictures of Saints painted or carued for hiſtory to remember not
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:2521:185"/>
to bee worshipped:</hi> this it may be is it you would be at; but I anſweare that both theſe and thoſe of yours if there, be any ſuch are to be vnderſtood in the ſenſe of his whole diſcourſe, to wit, that there is noe example in the Scriptures or Fathers of ſuch idolatrial adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he ſpeaketh againſt there: which is true. Which to be his meaning I shall by and by demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrate more plainely. Now for the laſt words; to wit, <hi>that images ought to be taken for an ornament to pleaſe the ſight, not to inſtruct the people.</hi> I doe not alſo find them, but theſe. <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piciamus picturam quaſi pictura ſenſu &amp; ratione ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentem: paſcatur hac viſione oculus Deu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vero veneretur animus. Let vs behold the picture as a picture wanting ſenſe &amp; reaſon.

               <p n="1">1. Wee are now come to the laſt. § of this chapter which is <hi>Indulgences;</hi> which you Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> beginne after your wonted manner with the tenth article of our <hi>Creede</hi> as you call it, and the Decree of the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath left that power of gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Indulgences</hi> in his Church: and that the <hi>Church</hi> hath vſed the ſame from moſt ancient tymes, and that therefore they are to be retained in the <hi>Church,</hi> condemning alſo whoſoeuer shall terme them vnprofitable, or deny authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the <hi>Church</hi> to grant them. Which doctrine you allow not of as not being agreable to <hi>Chriſt</hi> inſtitution, nor the practize of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue <hi>Fathers.</hi> You confeſſe indeede that in the Primitiue Church there was a power in the Bishops, to remit or mitigate the ſeuerity of the punishment, which by the <hi>Canons</hi> men were to vndergoe for certaine great crimes: which mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation you allow to haue beene called by the name of <hi>Indulgence;</hi> and in that ſenſe you take
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:2521:188" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that relaxation of the inceſtuous <hi>Corithian</hi> by S <hi>Paul.</hi> Thus farr you goe well with vs: but now you ſay the <hi>Indulgence</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is an abſolution from the guilt of temporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, by application of the merits of <hi>Chriſt</hi> &amp; his <hi>Saints,</hi> termed the treaſure of the Church. Which treaſure you ſay is applyed to the ſoules in Purgatory: and that which was formerly vſed for mitigation of punishment, is now reduced to priuate ſatisfaction, and that which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly left to the diſcretion of euery <hi>Bishop</hi> in his Dioceſſe, is transferred wholy to the Pope; and this not onely for ſome few yeares in this life, but for many thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds in Purgatory after death. 2. This is your diſcourſe Sir <hi>Humphrey.</hi> Which though you ſeeme to take to be a very good and ſubſtantiall one: yet is it nothing ſoe. For firſt it neither proueth any thing, nor ouerthroweth our doctrine of <hi>Indulgences,</hi> though that were true which you ſay of the difference betweene our <hi>Indulgence</hi> of theſe tymes and thoſe of the primitiue <hi>Church,</hi> for the vſe of thoſe tymes is not our onely ground for this point of doctrine: but wee haue others both of ſcripture, tradition, &amp; vndoubted practice of the Church for aboue a thouſand yeares at leaſt: and this of the practiſe of the Primitiue church in relaxation of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the poenitential canons is not vrged by vs at leſt by ſome of our Diuines as an euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t conuincing proofe but onely as coniectural and probable,<note place="margin">Suar. to. <hi>3.</hi> in <hi>3.</hi> pars. diſp. <hi>49</hi> ſect. <hi>2.</hi> n. <hi>4.5.</hi> &amp; ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:2521:188"/>
the <hi>Indulgences</hi> of our tymes and thoſe of other former tymes, as if by doeing that you had done all that was to be done.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But beſides to anſweare Secondly, you haue not done euen that: for you doe but onely make shew as if you would haue men thinke they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re different without shewing wherein the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence conſiſteth. Nay euen out of that which you graunt of thoſe ancient Indulge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces you may be diſproued in what you deny of ours for to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the very word <hi>(Indulgence)</hi> you graunt it to haue beene in vſe in thoſe tymes. But you ſay ours is an abſolution from the guilt of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral punishment, by application of the merits of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Which though alleadged as a difference yet doe I not ſee wherein the difference is. For theirs was an abſolution, becauſe it was an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looſing or vntying. For whereas by the <hi>Canons</hi> for certaine great crimes men were bound or tyed to vndergoe ſuch penance, for example to faſt with bread and water ſoe many dayes in a weeke, for ſoe many moneths, or yeares not to be admitted to the Sacraments, and Sacrifice of the Maſſe and the like, By this indulgence or pardon which you grant they were vntied or looſed from ſoe much, or ſoe little as by that pardon they were freed from: and ſoe is it in our Indulgence, wherefore the difference is not in the abſolution, which is nothing but looſing or vntying. It can not be alſo in the guilt, which muſt needs be remitted in your indulge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as well
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:2521:189"/>
as in ours. For a man is not free, ſoe long as he is guilty; if then they were freed by that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, the guilt was taken away thereby. It is not likewiſe in the temporal punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which is alike remitted in the one and other. For it was temporal punishment or penance, which men were freed from in thoſe tymes by indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and ſoe it is temporal punishment which wee are now adayes freed from by our indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. Wherefore I doe not vnderſtand what you meane Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> when you ſeeme to make a difference in this; ſaying that <hi>Indulgences</hi> which were firſt vſed for mitigation of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are now reduced to priuate, ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. For what? were not thoſe <hi>Indulgences</hi> giuen to priuate men, for ſatisfaction: or in lieu of that ſatisfaction which they were to make by the <hi>Canons?</hi> and are not ours mitigation of the ſame? vnleſſe you put the force in this that there the punishment was onely mitigated or leſſened, &amp; that in our <hi>Indulgence</hi> all is taken away; which yet is falſe on both ſides; for neither in ours, is all the punishment taken alwayes away; and in thoſe, ſometymes all was taken away, as we ſee by the example of the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> whom S. Paul doth forgiue without limitation: beſids this I do not imagine what you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meane in theſe words.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The difference alſo is not in the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or power, whereby this pardon is graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for then it was granted by the Bishops: and ſoe it is alſo now. For euery <hi>Bishop</hi> in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church hath this power. But you will ſay
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:2521:189"/>
                  <hi>Humphrey</hi> not ſoe much now as then be it ſoe? that is againſt your ſelfe for that is your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, that it is more vſed now then in thoſe tymes. But you ſay againe the <hi>Pope</hi> hath more now then he had then; and that all is transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red wholy to him. To which I anſweare that this later part is falſe: all is not ſoe wholy trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred but that euery Bishop: hath his part of this power, ouer his owne ſubiects; though with ſome limitation: and though the <hi>Pope</hi> should take it wholy to himſelf and from other <hi>Bishops,</hi> what is this againſt <hi>Indulgences?</hi> doth it alter the nature of them becauſe the <hi>Pope</hi> giueth them either more by himſelf, or more liberally then he did heeretofore by others? The power was in many before, now it is in one that one then hath more power then he had before, but is it not the ſame kind of power? wherefore the difference cannot conſiſt in this? but thinke not <hi>Sir</hi> that I grant you the <hi>Popes</hi> power to be more now then at that tyme it was, nor leſſe then the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now it is. It was the ſame of this power, as of all other his power of binding &amp; looſing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof this is one branch; which did euer extend ouer the whole Church ouer all paſtors, and all and euery one of their ſubiects, though he did permitt the vſe thereof to others ſome tymes more, ſometymes leſſe according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of tymes, places, and perſons. But this of the extent of the <hi>Popes</hi> power in this kind, is not a matter for this place, but it pertaineth to that diſputation of the <hi>Popes</hi> authority in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:2521:190"/>
It is enough heere, if we proue the ſame power and vſe of giuing Indulgences now, as was in moſt ancient tymes, as the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> declareth and you your ſelfe confeſſe in as much as you graunt that <hi>Indulgence</hi> and <hi>Pardon</hi> was granted by the Byshops then; Which we proue to be the ſame now: for neither doth the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> ſtand ſaying who hath mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, or who hath leſſe of that power, for that was needleſſe; the queſtion being with Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, who denyed the power wholy to be in God's Church.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The difference then betweene our <hi>Indulgence,</hi> and that of the primitiue Church, is not in this: that is in the power of granting it: Wherein the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? you may ſay as you ſeeme indeede to ſay that it conſiſteth in this, that ours is by application of the merits of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Saints,</hi> which we ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me <hi>the treaſure of the Church.</hi> And that their was a free relaxation without any ſuch reguard to this <hi>treaſure.</hi> But the difference cannot alſo be in this: for the Bishop's power whereby he did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don then, was grounded in the merits of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for what he did, he did in the perſon of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf, in forgiuing the <hi>Corinthian.</hi> Neither did he forgiue the guilt of the temporal punishment wholy gratis, or freely without any manner of ſatisfaction to the iuſtice of Almighty <hi>God,</hi> in as much at leſt as theſe penances were impoſed for ſatisfaction for the fault in the ſight of <hi>God</hi> alſoe: this I ſay the Bishop neither did, nor could doe for <hi>Chriſt</hi>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:2521:190"/>
himſelf did not forgiue ſinne ſoe: but by shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his bloud. For as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>in lege ſine ſanguine non fit remiſsio. In the Law there is no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes without bloud.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22.</note> Whereby the holy <hi>Apoſtle</hi> proueth that without the shedding of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> bloud, there is noe remiſſion of ſinne, and all forgiuenes of ſinne, as well for the guilt, as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, is dependent thereof. Wherefore what the Bishops did forgiue in this manner, they did forgiue by application of <hi>Chriſt</hi> his merits. Now theſe merits were not new, but the former merits of <hi>his</hi> life and paſſion: for <hi>Chriſt</hi> did conſummate all by one entire obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelfe as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14.</note> if then it were by vertue of thoſe merits, then muſt they needs lye in ſtore ready to be applied to men, as they did diſpoſe themſelues to receiue the fruit of them, and the Paſtours pleaſed to diſpence them; and why then may not <hi>Chriſt's</hi> merits lying thus in ſtore for the neede of all men, be compared to a common treaſure and be called by that name? Soe farr forth then as thoſe <hi>Pardons</hi> were grounded in <hi>Chriſt's</hi> merits or granted by application of them to the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, there is noe difference betweene theirs and ours.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now for the merits of the <hi>Saints:</hi> you ſeeme to ſay that they had noe part in thoſe indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; that is, thoſe Indulgences were not giuen by application of the merits of the Saints. But therein you are alſo miſtaken Sir <hi>Humphrey.</hi> For euen in that place of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> wherein
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:2521:191"/>
you allow him to ſpeake of <hi>Indulce,</hi> he ſaith he doth forgiue the <hi>Corithian,</hi> not onely in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but for their ſakes alſo: which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth the prayers and deſerts of <hi>Saints,</hi> to haue ſome place in the beſtowing of that indulgence, and ſoe likewiſe it was the practize of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, as you cannot but know, for Martyrs that had made a good confeſſion of their faith, and endured torments for the ſame, to make interceſſion to the Bishops, for relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing part of the punishment dew to others, who out of weaknes failed therein: and what was this but by applying the ſuperaboundant merits of the one, to ſupply the want of the other: and that this was not by way of impetration or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour onely at the Bishop's hand, but by applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the very Martyr's merits, appeareth by <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tertull. lib. de pud. cap. <hi>12.</hi>
                  </note> who being become now an Haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que did reprehend that cuſtome ſaying, that a Martyr's merits were litle enough for himſelfe, without hauing any ſurpluſage to helpe others withall: wherein yet he doth not ſeeme to deny this application, if men haue to ſpare of their owne ſatisfactions, as noe queſtion many and almoſt all great Saints haue. For though they may continually as long as they are in this world increaſe in grace and merits for ſoe much as pertaineth to eſſential merit, without hauing to ſpare but rather ſtill needing: which kind of merit, they cannot part with to others, yet for that other fruit of their works and ſufferings, which pertaineth to ſatisfaction and temporal
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:2521:191"/>
punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t dew for their owne ſinnes, they may haue ſufficient for themſelues &amp; to ſpare alſo to helpe others. For example a man falleth into ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me one ſinne, for which he cometh to be ſoe ſory after, that he betaketh himſelf to a ſtate of penance during his whole life, leading the ſame in great auſterity of faſting, watching, praying, and in the exerciſe of all Vertues: and it may be hauing firſt obtained pardon of the fault it ſelf by harty contrition and humble confeſſion, by thoſe good works obtaineth alſo remiſſion of the temporal punishment within the ſpace of 1. 2. 3. 7. 10. or 12. yeares for examples ſake: he then leading the ſame life ſtill 20. 30. 40. 50. 60. yeares more as many haue done what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of all that ſatisfaction, which is ouer and aboue for that ſinne or ſinnes, which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted before? it doth not perish nor paſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fruite, though not of him, yet of others at leaſt, who are members of the ſame miſtical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with him? ſoe then ſome men haue merits ſuperaboundant to this effect, and theſe merits may be communicated to other members of the ſame body, and theſe merits are not loſt nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by almighty God, though they be not applied preſently; why may not they then be ſaid to lye <hi>in depoſito</hi> as money in a treaſury?</p>
               <p n="7">7. In this therefore is not the difference betweene our <hi>Indulgence</hi> and thoſe which you allow; wherein then? I ſee not vnleſſe it be, that we extend our indulgence to the dead as indeed you ſeeme to make it in part. To this I
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:2521:192"/>
may anſweare firſt that it is another controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, or another point at leaſt of the ſame contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſy. For Indulgences are applied in a different manner to the liuing and the dead: and that definition which you giue that <hi>Indulgence</hi> is an abſolution from the guilt of temporall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth not pertaine to the dead: for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution is a iuridical act to be performed by a Superiour and iudge towards an inferiour and a ſubiect being vnder his power: which the ſoules in Purgatory are not in reſpect of the <hi>Pope.</hi> Wherefore you in going to indulgence for the dead ſeeme to allow them for the liuing, or rather shew you cannot ſay againſt them. Now for applying indulgences to the dead though the manner of application be different and that we doe not find examples altogether ſoe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as of the former, yet the things is in ſome ſort the ſame, ſuppoſing you grant the power of applying Indulgences to the liuing, as you cannot deny, your owne ground being laid; thus therefore I shew the matter to be the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, ſuppoſing another point alſoe of faith, which is not heere to be diſputed of, to wit, the communion of Saints, or communication which is betweene the Saints liuing and dead, either raigning in heauen or ſuffering in ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of their ſinnes in Purgatory. This I ſay ſuppoſed the punishment which was dew hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re by the poenitential canons may be taken away as you confeſſe; which being not taken away by indulgence, nor ſuffered heere accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:2521:192"/>
to the Canons, muſt be ſuffered there? why may it not then be taken away by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying indulgences to them there, as well as by works which other men may doe for them heere on earth. Which according to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique faith are auaileable for them there in Purgatory. Which communion, or communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation among themſelues being grounded in the ſociety and vnity which they haue with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> why may not the ſame Vnity and ſociety be ſufficient for them to partake of the merits and ſatisfactions of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Saints,</hi> who haue gone before, and left that treaſure of their merits, as well, as by the merits and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of men liuing heere vpon earth? there is noe difference then, nor reaſon why you should grant that ancient manner of indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and denye ours now a dayes; or why you should grant indulgences for the liuing, and not for the dead, ſoe long as they pertaine to the communion of Saints, and haue neede the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Now for that which you adde heere to make our Indulgences applied to the ſoules in <hi>Purgatory</hi> ridiculous, by ſaying we grant them for many thouſand of yeares after death, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reto citing an old Sarum booke of the howers of our <hi>Lady:</hi> it is falſe and idle. Falſe both becauſe your authority which you cite doth not mention Purgatory, but onely ſaith that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer shall ſay theſe &amp; theſe prayers, shall gaine
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:2521:193"/>
ſoe many thouſand yeares of pardon. Which is noe more for the dead then for the liuing, but onely that you doe not vnderſtand the matter either of the one or other; or rather they are for the liuing onely. For <hi>Indulgences</hi> are not to be applyed to the dead, vnleſſe that be expreſſed in the grant, which is not ſoe expreſſed in this grant of yours. It is alſo falſe becauſe the very thing which you ſay, and would proue by your authority is falſe, to wit, that we giue Pardons for thouſand of yeares in Purgatory after death. For we doe not ſoe, neyther doe we vnderſtand thoſe Pardons wherein are mentioned ſuch numbers of yeares ſoe, as if men were without thoſe Pardons to remaine ſoe long in Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But we vnderſtand thoſe yeares according to the poenitential canons, by which many yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res penance were dew for one ſinne. And many men's ſinnes being both very grieuous, and a man may ſay without number according to the account of the ancient poenitential canons, they may ſoone amount to thouſands of yeares; which though a man cannot liue to performe heere in this world, nor euen in Purgatory for the length of tyme, yet he may in Purgatory in few yeares ſpace, nay few moneths or few weekes ſpace ſuffer ſoe much punishment, as is anſwearable to all that penance of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of yeares, which a man should haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed heere if he could haue liued ſoe long: in which caſe a man may haue a pardon of ſoe many thouſand yeares as well as a plenary,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:2521:193"/>
both coming to one. What ſtrangeneſſe then or impoſſibility is therein this diſcourſe if you did vnderſtand it that you should thinke onely by a ſcorneful laugh to diſgrace or diſproue it? It is alſo idle for you to vrge any thing that you find in any old booke, as if that were preſently of vncontrollable authority, being nothing ſoe. For we defend nothing but what hath ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient approbation or allowance of the <hi>Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Church,</hi> which many ſuch old books as you cite want: you should therefore haue added that withal if you had meant to proue any thing thereby.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Now after this, you tell vs, that long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Luther's</hi> dayes by relation of <hi>Thomas Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> whom yet you cite not but onely out of <hi>Valencia,</hi> ſome whereof opinion that eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Indulgence of it ſelfe could remitt noe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, neither in the Court of God, nor of the Church, but that they were a pious kind of fraud to draw men to doe good works, but this opinion you ſay the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> condemneth for erroneous? and why I pray you Sir could you not as well ſay that S. <hi>Thomas</hi> did condemne the ſame not onely for erroneous, but impious alſo; but onely becauſe you would make your Reader thinke it was condemned onely by the <hi>Ieſuit,</hi> and not by S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> or rather that hee did as it were winke at it: but how farre S. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> was from that, and how free on the other ſide any man may ſee, by this, that putting the queſtion in the 1. ar. of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:2521:194"/>
indulgences auaile any thing, he maketh anſweare, that all grant that they auaile ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, becauſe it were impious ſaith he, to ſay that the Church did doe any thing in vayne: and in the 2. art. asking how much they auaile, he ſaith that ſome ſay they auaile to euery one but according to their faith and deuotion he himſef ſaith, it is very perilous to ſay that they doe not auaile ſoe much as they ſound: that is, to ſoe much effect or pardon, as they are giuen for. Wherefore the antiquity of this opinion no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing auaileth you but rather doth you harme it being then condemned for an errour: as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewiſe it auaileth you not, that you bring halfe a dozen of our authours, witneſſing that there is noe expreſſe proofe of Scripture nor of ſome ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> as S. <hi>Aug.

                  </note> therefore you are ſtill out of your bias, when you thinke to proue the nouelty of our doctrine, by our want of teſtimony of antiquity. For though we haue ſuch teſtimony for ſuperaboundant proofe, yet it is enough that ſuch a thing is thaught and practized in Catholique Church, without any memory when it beganne, for that is S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> rule continually to proue a thing not onely <hi>ancient,</hi> but euen <hi>Apoſtolical.</hi>

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:2521:197"/>
weake and ſenſeleſſe faith that giueth aſſent to it without authority of Scriptures, and conſent of <hi>Fathers.</hi> Your meaning is by a fine rhetorical figure, to ſay it is preſumption, by ſaying you will not ſay ſoe: but Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> I will goe the plaine way to worke with you; and tell you it is intolerable preſumption for you, ſuppoſe you were a man of learning, to take vpon you to cenſure of preſumption ſoe great a <hi>Councel</hi> as that of <hi>Trent,</hi> wherein the whole flower of the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> for learning and ſanctity was gathered together, the ſplendour whereof was ſo great that your night owle Haeretiques durſt not once appeare, though they were invited and promiſed to goe and come freely with all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity they could wish: and for ſuch a fellow as you, to make your ſelfe iudge thereof what intolerable preſumption is it? it is preſumption with you forſooth for a <hi>Councel</hi> to define a point of faith vpon the perpetual and conſtant beleife and practize of the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> &amp; vpon the common conſent of <hi>Doctours,</hi> being both of them ſufficient rules of faith of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, there being withall ſufficient teſtimony of Scripture in the ſenſe which it hath euer beene vnderſtood by Catholique interpreters: and yet it is not preſumption for you, without Doctour, without Father, without Councel, without Scripture, without any manner of authority to goe againſt all this authority.</p>

                  <note place="margin">De verbo Dei. lib. <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> but for conſent of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:</hi> it is true, it is requiſite becauſe we haue not the <hi>tradition</hi> but by conſent of <hi>Fathers:</hi> but this conſent of <hi>Fathers</hi> is noe more required to bee by their expreſſe teſtimonies in writing, then in the Scripture it ſelfe. For where doe you find that the <hi>holy Fathers</hi> did know, beleeue, or practize noe more but what they did write? or that any one did write in particular all the whole beleife of the <hi>Catholique Church?</hi> the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> did in their writings as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did in theirs, that is write of this or that particular matter, as the particular occaſion of anſwearing ſome Haeretique or inſtructing ſome <hi>Catholique</hi> did require, and therefore mentioned noe more then was needfull for that end. But the conſent of <hi>Fathers</hi> is moſt of all proued, by the practize of the Catholique Church, of the preſent tyme, ſeing that practize being without beginning cannot otherwiſe haue beene but from thoſe that haue gone before from tyme to tyme: and though you make a difference, yet certainely it is the ſame of the conſent of Catholique Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours in the preſent tyme, as it was of <hi>holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>

This I doe not ſay, that wee want ſufficient proofe of antiquity for any point; but to shew that we neede it not ſoe expreſſe in ancient authors but that the very practize of the Catholique Church is ſufficient to ſtopp the mouth of any contentious Haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, noe leſſe then in ancient tymes, when that proofe of foregoing Writers could haue noe place.

               <p n="15">15. But becauſe you may yet make difficulty in this teſtimony, which you alleadge as though it alone should ſtand againſt all other that can be alleadged out of him, and that noe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of any man els, can be able to ſatisfy you, I will alleadge his owne words interpreting
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:2521:201"/>
the meaning of S. <hi>Paul's</hi> words, which he allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth &amp; vſeth in this teſtimony to shew that the word <hi>(beſide)</hi> doth not import, that a man muſt not beleeue any thing but that which is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Scripture, but that a man muſt not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue any thing contrary. For thus he ſaith. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> did not ſay if any man eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelize to you more then you haue receiued,<note place="margin">Aug. to. <hi>98.</hi> in Io.</note> but beſide that which you haue receiued. For if he should ſay that, he should praeiudicate (that is goe againſt) himſelfe, who coueted to come to the <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> that he might ſupply that which was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to their faith. But he that ſupplieth addeth that which was lacking taketh not away that which was &amp;c. Theſe are the <hi>Saint's</hi> very words in that place. By which it is plaine that he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the word <hi>(praeter) beſide</hi> not in that ſenſe as to ſignify more then is written as you would vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it; but to ſignify the ſame that <hi>(contra) againſt</hi> or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to what is written.

Which to be his meaning is yet more plaine by his whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which is to shew what ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or priuate reuelation is to bee admitted: &amp; indeede there hee alloweth of ſuch as it <hi>not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the rule of the Catholique faith contra regulam Catholicae fidei:</hi> &amp; reprehends only in Haeretiques ſuch kind of knowledge as is alſo contrary or againſt the rule of faith, and then obiecting this very place which you ſoe often repeate out of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to himſelf, he anſweareth it by expounding

the word <hi>praeter</hi> in the ſame ſenſe with <hi>contra.</hi> Which ſtandeth very well alſo with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the Latine word: and for the Greeke it the ſame both heere <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 8. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17.

            </head>
            <p n="1">1. SIr <hi>Humphrey</hi> hauing in the two former Sections proued the antiquity and Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſality of his faith both in general &amp; in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, (as he would haue vs thinke;) cometh now to proue the certainty thereof and vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of ours. Where a man would expect he ſhould bring ſome new thing either reaſon or authority, but he doth neither, but onely vpon the rotten ground which he ſuppoſeth he hath laid very ſoundly in the precedent Sections, he goeth on very confidently with the certainty of his faith, and making a ſhort preface, how he hath out of our owne authours proued, that the faith &amp; doctrine now taught in the Church of Rome was not knowne informer ages: and that though the Prieſts, eſpecially <hi>Ieſuits</hi> are bound by oath to maintaine the Papacy, yet that it can not be denied, but that we haue te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified againſt our ſelues in behalfe of his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and howſoeuer we excuſe the matter, yet
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:2521:204"/>
we are diuided among our ſelues, and ſoe want vnity of faith. After this preface I ſay, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a ſhort reuiew of our confeſſions for him, in matter of <hi>Iuſtification, tranſubſtantiation, priuate Maſſe, Sacraments, Communion in one kinde, prayer in an vnknowne tongue, Worshipping of Images and Indulgences.</hi> Vpon which he calleth men &amp; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to witneſſe, that we haue noe antiquity, &amp; vniuerſality, and that conſequently we haue reſolued the grand queſtion touching their Church before <hi>Luther,</hi> to wit, that it was in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in the <hi>Fathers,</hi> in the boſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of the ancient Church before <hi>Luther's</hi> tyme. This is the ſumme of almoſt halfe this Sectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in all which I muſt appeale, <hi>gentle Reader,</hi> to thy indifferent iudgment. Whether there be a true word or noe? For ſuppoſing that thou haſt read what is gone before, thou wilt eaſily ſee, that though it were not my taske heere to proue the antiquity of the points of our <hi>Faith,</hi> or vniuerſality, or any thing els; but onely to anſweare the fond obiections of Sir <hi>Humphrey;</hi> Yet I haue accidentally and by the way proued the ſame in moſt points, and by the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, and places, which he bringeth againſt vs; and his fayling in his proofes of our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelty, is ſufficient proofe of our antiquity, and his owne nouelty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What a ſhameful boaſt then is it for him to ſay, that moſt of our points now taught were vnknowne to antiquity: For though ſome might perchance not haue beene ſoe anciently
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:2521:205"/>
defined, and conſequently doubted of by ſome, yet to ſay they were not commonly beleiued and much more to ſay they were not knowne, cannot come frome any man but ſuch a blinde but bold Bayard as Sir <hi>Humphrey Linde.</hi> For if one man or two doubt of a thing, muſt it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be vnknowne? when not onely one or two on the other ſide, but two for one, or rather ten, nay a hundred for one ſay the contrary. Now lett him name that one of his points of faith heere by him diſputed, wherein not onely ſince it was defined, which is enough for our purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, but euen before that; we shall not bring him a great many, that held that way, which it was defined, for euery one of thoſe that held the other way. How then could it be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne? The next thing in his praeface is of an Oath, which our Prieſts, eſpecially <hi>Ieſuits</hi> take, to defend the Papacy and doctrine of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> But if a man should aske him where he findeth this Oath, he would not be able ſoe readily to tell vs; though if he could, I ſee not why any man should be ashamed of it: nay why he should not glory of ſoe heroical an act, as is an oath: whereby he bindeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the defence of the <hi>authority,</hi> whereon the waight &amp; frame of the whole <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> and ſaluation of all ſoules from <hi>Chriſt</hi> his owne tyme to the very end of the world, hath, doth, and ſtill shall depend. But this I onely note for the <hi>Knight's</hi> ignorance; for I beleeue the thing he would be at, is the <hi>fourth vow</hi> of the <hi>Ieſuits,</hi>
               <pb n="349" facs="tcp:2521:205" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Whereby they ſpecially bind themſelues in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Sea <hi>Apoſtolique,</hi> to goe in Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to any part of the world, whether infidel or haeretique; which is a little different at leaſt from that which he talketh of an oath to defend the Papacy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third thing in his praeface is want of Vnity wherewith he chargeth vs. Whereof I onely ſay that as we confeſſe there may be difference of iudgments before a definition of faith, ſoe lett him shew the diuiſion after ſuch definition. Lett him name that man, and we will giue him leaue to take him for his owne, to encreaſe his Church and make vpp his number of learned men: for noe man but an haeretique can diſpute againſt what is once defined. Catholique Doctors may indeede differ in opinion ſoe long as a thing is vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. For ſoe long it is not faith, but when it is once defined they muſt be ſilent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre all in one, becauſe then it is matter of faith. Which agreement and concurrence of opinion in ſuch a caſe sheweth there was ſtill before a kind of radical vnion, that is, a praepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of mind or promptnes to ſubmitt to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> when it should shew it ſelf: Wherefore whatſoeuer hee or any man els shall ſay of our differences are but arguments for the vnity and certainty of our beleife.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Now for his reuiew of all his. 8. points, it is but a reuiew indeede; wherein he taketh all that he ſaid before for true, as if
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:2521:206" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he had carried all ſmooth before him, which prouing quite contrary, all this reuiew and diſcourſe builded thereon, falleth to the ground. Neither will I ſtand examining them all heere againe, but remitt the Reader to what is ſaid particularly of each one in his owne place. Onely heere I will reflect vpon his concluſion, which is a witneſſing of men and Angels, that we haue noe antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Vniuerſality for proofe of our articles. For his proteſtations and witneſſings, there are many examples gone before which shew how foolish, falſe, and hypocritical they are: of this therefore I ſay noe more, but that it may goe with the reſt. But I aske him how he proueth, we haue noe antiquity? For his firſt point, he laboureth to proue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our <hi>Iuſtification by words</hi> out of a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual in S. <hi>Anſelmes</hi> dayes ſome fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares ſince, that the ſicke party was to putt all his truſt in <hi>Chriſt's merits.</hi> Which thing I shewed to be nothing againſt vs. Wherein then hath he derogated from the antiquity and Vniuerſality of our Doctrine? and though that proofe had beene good, that is to ſay, againſt what we teach of <hi>iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> what could the bare authority of ſoe late a worke haue preiudiced our antiquity, which we maintaine 1000. yeares before that tyme? Or what could that doctrine taught in ſuch an obſcure booke of I know not whoſe writing, nor of what authority and but in a
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:2521:206"/>
corner of the world, praeiudice the Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of our doctrine taught in all tymes, in all countryes, by Fathers and Doctors in their ſeueral tymes, and in general Councels? or doth it shew his doctrine to be ancient becauſe it was taught 500. ſince, or Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal becauſe it was taught in <hi>England?</hi> noe ſuch matter. In his ſecond point of <hi>tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> he bringeth one man ſaying the words of conſecration doe not of themſelues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the explication of the <hi>Church</hi> proue the realnes of Chriſt's praeſence in the Sacrament, another man ſaying they doe not proue <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,</hi> or that it was defined but in the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Lateran</hi> about 500. yeares agoe, to which: We anſweare againe that thoſe one or two ſay nothing againſt vs, in the points of controuerſy with haeretiques, and euen in that which they teach contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent of <hi>Diuines,</hi> though in matters not defined, we ſay they are reproued not by one or two, but by all the whole current of <hi>Catholique Diuines,</hi> what is this then againſt the antiquity of our Doctrine? or doth it proue his Doctrine to be ancient or vniuerſall? nay doth it proue it any Doctrine at all? For what can any man tell by this what he beleeues, much leſſe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be true or noe which he beleeueth? may not another man that denieth the Proteſtant-Lord's-Supper proue the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and vniuerſality of his doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne or rather his denyal of doctrine
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:2521:207"/>
as the Knight doth his, and by the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Becauſe a man denieth one point of ours, doth he preſently allow all his? may not he find a third way of his owne different from both: and if the Reader pleaſe to marke it, all the knights proofe of antiquity is the denial or doubt made by ſome one of our Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters though that one of ours be much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him in other things, as a man may ſee both in <hi>Caietane, Scotus,</hi> and the reſt as I ſaid before. His diſcourſe then in this is as deuoyd of reaſon, as his Doctrine is of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. point, he bringeth a great many authorityes to proue that anciently the people did communicate euery day with the Prieſt, which we grant: and aske againe what this derogateth from the antiquity of our Doctrine or how it proueth that a Prieſt is bound to forbeare ſaying Maſſe, if there be noe body to communicate or that it is ill and vnlawfull for him to ſay Maſſe in that caſe? or how it proueth the antiquity or vniuerſality of his doctrine, that denieth all Maſſe? nay doe not we moreouer <hi>ex abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danti</hi> proue, that the cuſtome of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples daily Communion did ceaſe, euen in the Primitiue Church, and yet that ſome Prieſts did ſay Maſſe daily? Doe not wee then proue our <hi>antiquity</hi> not onely by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of his erroneous nouelty, but euen by poſitiue proofes drawne from antiquity?
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:2521:207"/>
Concerning the number of <hi>Sacraments</hi> he ſaith, ſome teach there be 3. ſome 4. ſome 5. ſome 6; that ſome ſay of this Sacrament it was not inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> others of that, ſome ſay this Sacrament is not proued out of this place of Scripture, another not out of the other. Now ſuppoſe all this were true, as I haue diſproued him almoſt in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word he ſaieth, and shewed his folly, Doth this proue the antiquity or vniuerſality of his Doctrine? is not the number of 5. or 6. as farre from his number of two, as from ours of 7. and the number of 3. or 4. as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with his number of two as with ours of ſeauen? What madnes is it then in a man, to thinke by this diſprouing of our number, to thinke his owne to be ſoe preſently proued, as if a man could not deny 7. but hee muſt affirme onely two? For as for his proofe out of ſome <hi>Fathers,</hi> naming of two, he confeſſeth others name three, others 5. ſome more ſome leſſe: which he bringeth to diſproue our ſeauen: but how doth it ſtand with his two? Soe of his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in one Kind</hi> he ſaith out of many of our authors it was anciently vſed in both, and we grant it; but we ſay it was alſo vſed in <hi>One</hi> many tymes, and might haue beene more and may alſo be now in <hi>One</hi> or <hi>both,</hi> as it shall ſeeme good to the <hi>Church,</hi> according to diuers circumſtances,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:2521:208" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in whoſe power is the adminiſtration of the Sacraments. How doth the affirming of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part, or denying of the later proue the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of his doctrine which is, that it is not lawful to adminiſter in one kind. For <hi>publique Prayer</hi> he ſaith out of ſome of our authors, it was vſed in a knowne tongue in the Primitiue Church. We grant it and ſay it is ſoe ſtill. For as <hi>Hebrew, Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> were then the moſt knowne to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gues in which onely the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were written and publiquely read, ſoe the ſame languages are ſtill vſed partly becauſe they are ſacred and partly becauſe they are moſt knowne. What then maketh that againſt our Latine <hi>Maſſe?</hi> or rather is it not a proofe of our antiquity and diſproofe of his nouelty? Againſt <hi>image-worship</hi> he talketh of the 2. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the hate of the <hi>Iewes</hi> againſt <hi>Images.</hi> Hee bringeth the teſtimonyes of ſome Haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques againſt them, and the ſaying of ſome one Diuine of the manner of worshipp, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſion of others againſt the abuſes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the adoration of them: out of all which ſetting the teſtimonyes of Haeretiques a part, I aske what he would conclude? Or how he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth our <hi>Worship</hi> which we allow? or how the reprehenſion of abuſes in ſome of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler ſort of <hi>Catholiques,</hi> ſuppoſe there be ſome ſuch abuſes, proueth the lawfulnes of his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge breaking, or the truth and antiquity of his doctrine? though his Doctrine, in this point
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:2521:208" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be but onely the denial of ours. Now we proue ouer and aboue out of ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels</hi> the antiquity of our <hi>Worshipping</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> and their <hi>pictures.</hi> Laſtly of <hi>Indulgences</hi> he ſaith out of ſome of our <hi>Diuines,</hi> that there is noe expreſſe teſtimony of Scripture and <hi>Fathers</hi> for the <hi>antiquity</hi> of them. To which wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare that as, this notwithſtanding theſe very men doe not deny the <hi>antiquity</hi> of <hi>Indulgences</hi> for want of ſuch proofe, ſoe others alſo proue the ancient vſe of them, euen out of other <hi>moſt ancient Fathers</hi> of the <hi>primitiue Church.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the controuerſy amongſt thoſe <hi>Diuines</hi> is not of the <hi>Indulgences</hi> themſelues, or doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, but onely of the <hi>Vſe</hi> of them: or ſuppoſe it were ſoe that one or two Diuines did thinke amiſſe of them, doth that proue the <hi>antiquity</hi> of his Doctrine? may not thoſe very <hi>Diuines,</hi> be againſt him in other things. What ancient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of authority hath he brought to proue his Doctrine? not <hi>Durand,</hi> nor any man els who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is by him pretended to thinke hardeſt of them: &amp; though he had <hi>Durand</hi> wholy for him, how could his bare authority or ſaying make the denying doctrine <hi>ancient</hi> being but 400. yeares agoe, or <hi>vniuerſal</hi> being but one man and contradicted by others.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And thus hauing made a reuiew op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to his, I would faine ſee what any man can find should moue Men, much leſſe Angels to witneſſe the <hi>antiquity</hi> or <hi>vniuerſality</hi> of his Doctrine? nay doth not his manner

Now then that you haue spoken ſoe well of the <hi>certainty</hi> of your owne beleife, let vs heare what you ſay of the <hi>vncertainty</hi> of ours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you begin thus. That for farther proofe of your cauſe, you will giue another ſummons to the prime men euen of our grand inqueſt, who without partiality will teſtify on your behalfe, that your <hi>Church</hi> is built vpon a more ſtable and ſure foundation, then the now <hi>Romane Church;</hi> and that your doctrine is more fruiteful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and euery way more ſafe and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the beleife of euery Chriſtian, and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the beleeuer. Which you proue laying way for a ground what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, that noe man can be certaine by the certainty of faith, that he doth receiue a true Sacrament; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that depends vpon the intention of the Miniſter, whereof noe man can be certaine. By which one tenet (you ſay,) we ouerthrow all certainty of true faith. Which you exemplify in <hi>Baptiſme</hi> wherein if there want the intention of the Baptizer, the Baptized is ſtill an heathen, and in ſtate of damnation: Soe of <hi>Order</hi> if the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Ordainer</hi> faile, it is noe Sacrament; and conſequenty, if this intention were wanting

But I pray you good Sir <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> ſay truely, are you in earneſt or in ieſt? me thinkes by the matter you should meane onely in ieſt it is ſoe idle: but though this were your beſt excuſe, yet becauſe you may take that ill I take you in earneſt, as you ſeeme to

meane it, and aske what certainty you or any Proteſtant hath, or can haue that you are Chriſtians, if you thinke that your Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity dependeth vpon the Sacrament of Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. If you thinke it doe not, (as it is the doctrine of the Puritans indeede;) that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme is not any cauſe of grace, but onely a ſigne or ſeale of the adoption, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by carnal propagation from their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full parents; and it ſeemeth alſo yours, by what you ſay both heere and before in your 4. §. of Sacraments in the definition of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; if, I ſay, you thinke ſoe, then I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe you neede not feare the Miniſter's want of intention, but that pertaineth to another diſputation: but yet you haue as little cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty or leſſe of your chriſtendome ſtill, for what know you whither your Parents were of the faithfull, or noe; that is, whither they did beleiue there was a God, or what they did beleiue of him: and ſoe of your owne Children if their chriſtendome depend vpon yours or your wiues faith, it may be they may bee much more vncertaine thereof, then we are by depending vpon our Prieſts inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for noe man can know your inward beleife: but find you what you will, we shall ſtill find ſome man's intention or other that shall make your faith or Chriſtendome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, vnleſſe you can proue you were

Chriſtned by <hi>God</hi> himſelfe: which ſure you will not goe about to doe.</p>
            <p n="8">8. But howſoeuer you extenuate the force and neceſſity of <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> for <hi>Matrimony,</hi> I ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe you will not wholy abrogate it, though you put it out from among the <hi>Sacraments;</hi> and of it I aske what certainty you can haue of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of your owne Marriage, or legitimation of you children? You cannot ſay but the validity of that contract dependeth vpon the intention and conſent of the partyes, though not of your Miniſter; as wee alſoe ſay it dependeth not vpon the intention of our Prieſt, but of the partyes which marry, which we ſay commonly are the Miniſters in this Sacrament. Wherefore if (for example) your wife had no intention when she ſpake the words of Marriage, it is noe Marriage but fornication and conſequently your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are baſtards, nay though the matter should haue depended wholy vpon your owne inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in your marriage and that you be a great deale more ſure of it then you can be as it is now depending vpon your wiues intention alſo, yet is that ſurety farre from the certainty of diuine faith, and ſoe you are in noe better caſe for that matter then wee. For <hi>Order</hi> I might likewiſe inſtance the ſame among you but a ſmall deale of <hi>Order</hi> ſerues your turnes, for I ſee not any thing done by vertue of your <hi>Ordination;</hi> which any man or woman may not doe without it. Therefore for vs I anſweare, it is cleane a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thing of the certainty of the Catholique
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:2521:211"/>
faith, which we maintaine, and of euery man's priuate or particular beleife of his owne iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or ſaluation which we deny to be ſoe certaine, the one being grounded vpon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God's diuine truth and reuelation, the other vpon humane knowledge, or rather coniecture; it is one thing to ſay there be 7. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and that theſe Sacraments, doe giue grace, where they are duely adminiſtred, with all things requiſite on the part both of the giuer and receiuer; and another to ſay they are ſoe to me: that is that in my receiuing of any one of them, all things haue concurred both on the Prieſts part and myne; the former is reuealed by <hi>God,</hi> and propounded by his Church; the later is not reuealed in any ſcripture, and therefore by your owne rule can be noe matter of faith. For the inconuenience therefore which you ſay may follow (though any way that you can inuent, I doe not thinke but there wilbe two for one, and farre greater) I anſweare, that though in matter of Baptiſme, Ordination &amp;c. there may happen ſome defect in this, or that particular caſe for want of intention, matter, forme, or the like, yet it belongeth to the prouidence of almighty <hi>God,</hi> not to permitt any vniuerſal or euen great defect to happen and ſoe though we be not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine by certainty of diuine faith, that this or that man in particular is truely baptized, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a Prieſt, yet we are certaine by the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of diuine faith, that not onely there be ſuch Sacraments but that they are alſo truely
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:2521:212"/>
adminiſtred in the Catholique Church ſoe as there can be noe danger of the fayling of either, or of any danger which may enſue therevpon, to the notable praeiudice of faith and ſaluation of ſoules; and withall though we be not certaine by certainty of faith of euery particular, yet wee haue moral certainty, that is as much certainty as there can be of any humane thing, which dependeth of the action or intention of any man; which as we ſee it is enough for men to reſt themſelues ſecure in all worldy matters, concerning their liues, and goods, which moſt men prize aboue their ſoules, ſoe it may alſo giue a man ſufficient ſecurity in matters of his ſoule, eſpecially ſince as we ſay, if he be not wanting to himſelf, almighty God will not of his goodnes ſuffer him through another man's fault to want any thing neceſſary for his ſaluation: but will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite him to contrition for forgiuenes of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or to make doubt and ſeeke whether he haue thoſe neceſſary thinges or noe? But yet with this ſecurity there remaineth a place for an holy feare which may keepe downe our pride and make vs shake of all torpour exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cizing our ſelues in good workes and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our ſaluation with feare and trembling. But of this kind of faith it is not that wee meane when wee diſpute with haeretiques of the certainty of true faith, but of <hi>faith</hi> as it is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife and doctrine deliuered in general abſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from this or that man, whether he beleeue
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:2521:212"/>
aright or be certaine of his beleife, that is, that he beleeueth; wherefore Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> in chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the queſtion, herein, you committ a notable groſſe aequiuocation of termes which is a fowle fault in a Scholler as you are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth.</p>
            <p n="9">9. But from this you paſſe to another point of vncertainty, or rather an other kind of proofe of our vncertainty thus. You ſay we are vncertaine whether the Saints heare our prayers or not: and whither ſome that we pray vnto be Saints in heauen or diuels in hell: the later you proue out of <hi>Caiet.</hi> becauſe he ſaith that the miracles whereon the Church groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the canonization of Saints, cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly knowne, and out of Saint <hi>Auguſt.</hi> and <hi>Sulpitius,</hi> the one ſaying ſome were tormented in hell, which were worshipped on earth, the other ſaying that the common people wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped for a Martyr one that was damned, and who appeared and told them ſoe: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vncertainty to wit whether the Saints heare our prayers,<note place="margin">Gab. in can. lect. <hi>31.</hi> Mag. in <hi>4.</hi> d. <hi>45.</hi>
               </note> you proue out of <hi>Gabr.</hi> and <hi>Pet. Lomb.</hi> the one ſaying it is not certaine, but it may ſeeme probable that <hi>God</hi> reuealeth vnto Saints all thoſe ſutes which men preſent vnto them. The other that it is not incredible that the Soules of Saints heare the prayers of their ſuppliants. Well be it ſoe Sir <hi>Hum.</hi> let it be vncertain as you ſay it is whether the Saints hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re our prayers or not: yet it followes not for all
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:2521:213"/>
that, that our doctrine of inuocation of Saints is vncertaine. For as <hi>Bellar.</hi> well noteth, it might be good and profitable to inuoke the Saints though they themſelues should not heare vs but onely almighty God for them, what are you the better then? But beſids it is not vncertaine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Saints heare vs or noe, that is, it is not vncertaine whether they know our prayers or not. For though there be queſtion of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how they know them; yet there is noe queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but that they doe know them. Neither is <hi>Gabriel's</hi> authority or <hi>Peter Lombard's</hi> by you alleadged any thing to the contrary. For they onely make doubt of the manner without any doubt of the thing it ſelfe, as is moſt manifeſt by their very diſcourſe and words, in thoſe very places where you tooke out your; for thus, ſaith <hi>Gabriel. Non inuocantur Sancti tanqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> datores bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum pro quibus oramus, ſed tanquam interceſſores apud Deum bonorum omnium largitorem. The Saints are inuocated not as the giuers of good things for which we pray; but as interceſſours to God the giuer of all good.</hi> Where you ſee he ſpeaketh not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, but certainely of inuocation: and ſoe goeth on with his diſcourſe prouing, that notwithſtanding that almighty <hi>God</hi> be of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe moſt propitious and merciful, yet that doth not hinder but that the Saints may pray for vs; and after that falleth to diſcourſe of the manner how the Saints heare our prayers. The like, I may ſay of <hi>Peter Lombard.</hi> Who though he ſay onely in thoſe words which you bring, that
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:2521:213"/>
it is not incredible that the Saints heare our prayers, yet for their hearing or ſeing our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the word of God as the Angels doe, he maketh noe doubt. <hi>Sicut enim Angelisit, a etiam Sanctis qui Deo aſsiſtunt, petitiones noſtrae innoteſcunt in verbo Dei quod contemplantur,</hi> ſaith he: <hi>For as our prayers become knowne to the Angels in the word of God which they behold ſo alſo to the Saints who ſtand before God.</hi> Soe as heere is ſomething more <hi>Sir Humphrey</hi> with your good leaue then proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and vncertainty, in the iudgment of theſe Doctors, though you be pleaſed to conclude out of them that there is nothing but probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and vncertainty: though if there were but probability onely it were more then you haue for any point of your faith as it is yours.</p>
            <p n="10">10. For <hi>Caietan's</hi> authority concerning the miracles whereon the canonization of Saints is grounded, it is true as he ſaith, the authority of them is but humane as relying vpon the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of man. But what then? ergo we are vncertaine whether the canonized Saint bee in heauen or noe? this is your concluſion, and it is like one of yours indeede. But I anſweare that it followeth not; for the certainty of cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vpon a more certaine ground, to wit, the authority of the Sea Apoſtolique, and continuall aſſiſtance and direction of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> the Spirit of truth, to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not to ſuffer <hi>Chriſt's Vicar</hi> vſing huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne diligence, and proceeding prudently in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that moment to erre: and the proofe of
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:2521:214"/>
miracles is onely vſed, that he may proceede prudently, &amp; vpon good ground, &amp; in that ſenſe Miracles are ſaid to ground the canonization of Saints, not that the certainty of the one doth wholy depend on the certainty of the other. Soe as <hi>Caietan</hi> helpeth you not a iot to proue the vncertainty of our canonization of Saints, noe more then doth <hi>S. Aug.</hi> and <hi>Sulpitius</hi> in thoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorityes which you bring out of them. For they ſpeake not a word of any canonized Saint. And as for the place of <hi>S. Aug. Bellarm.</hi> anſweareth that <hi>perhaps it is not his,</hi> which word <hi>perhaps</hi> you take hold of, as if you would make your Reader thinke it is but a ſlender anſweare, or rather a grant of the authority: whereas it is farr other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. For <hi>Bell.</hi> vſeth that word out of modeſty, becauſe as he ſaith he could neuer find it in any worke of <hi>S. Aug.</hi> Which notwithſtanding, he will not ſay peremptorily it is not there, but if you will needs haue it S. <hi>Auguſtin's, Sir Humfrey</hi> tell vs where out of your great reading, &amp; then you shall find 3. or 4. ſeueral anſweares ready in <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> without any <hi>peraduentures:</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede any man of ordinary witt will preſently ſee the place doth not vrge a whit. For who doth doubt but many dead men are mightily honoured by ſome men heere vpon earth, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ſoules are buried full low in hell: another an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> is; that if there be any ſuch place in <hi>S. Aug.</hi> it may be very well vnderſtood of the Martyrs of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> who were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by thoſe haeretiques for Martyrs whoſe
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:2521:214"/>
ſoules were tormented in Hell: as the ſame B. Saint ſaith of them elſewhere.<note place="margin">Aug. ep. <hi>68</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Viuebant vt latro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, honorabantur vt Martyres. They liued as theeues and were honoured as Martyrs:</hi> But what is this to our canonized Saints? is heere any the leaſt shaddow thereof? For that ſtory of <hi>Sulpitius,</hi> it is true, that there was one worshipped by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for a Martyr indeede, but hee was farre from any canonization of the <hi>Church.</hi> For as the Story ſayth, S. <hi>Martin</hi> ſeeing the people worship a dead man, &amp; not knowing what he was, nor hauing any certainety from thoſe that went before, of him, he miſliked their deuotion, and prayed to God that he might know what Man that was, &amp; ſoe by the appointement of <hi>God</hi> the man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and confeſſed himſelfe to haue beene an high way theife that was put to death by the hand of iuſtice for his wickedneſſe. This is the ſtory and this we alleadge as a reaſon among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers why the iudgment of the <hi>Church</hi> is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in the canonization of Saints, that people may not be deceiued in worshipping wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for Saints, giuing the honor, dew to almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God's freinds, to his enemyes. It is therefore good ſport to ſoe a right learned <hi>knight</hi> as you are forſooth by a new ſtrayne of witt to bring it to proue the vncertainty of our canonization, wherein you muſt argue thus. Some people in <hi>S. Martin's</hi> tyme did erre in worshipping a dead theife for a Saint, without any ſufficient reaſon or approbation of the Church, <hi>ergo</hi> Catholiques may erre in worshipping of Saints canonized
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:2521:215"/>
and authorized by the <hi>Church,</hi> vpon great and euident proofes of their holy liues and deathes, and vpon many and manifeſt miracles. Is not this a trimme argument to be printed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed?</p>
            <p n="11">11. In the next place you come with the vncertainety of <hi>Purgatory</hi> whereof you ſay <hi>S. Aug.</hi> ſaith thus.

It is there related how when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of <hi>S.

Wherevpon the <hi>Saint</hi> appearing to her in her ſleepe she was taken with a very vehement paine in her backe for 4. dayes together till the ſame <hi>Saint</hi> appearing to her againe in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, willed her to goe to <hi>S. Anaſtaſius</hi> in ſuch a place of the towne where his Reliques &amp; picture were kept, <hi>she</hi> not knowing all this while who it was that appeared vnto her: and ſoe awaking <hi>she</hi> was caried thither, &amp; as ſoone as <hi>she</hi> came in the ſight of the picture, <hi>she</hi> cried out that, that was the man that in her ſleepe foretold her the miſery which <hi>she</hi> was fallen into: and when <hi>she</hi> had <hi>proſtrated her ſelfe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ground before his pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> and wept, and thereby appeaſed the <hi>Saint, she</hi> was reſtored to her former health. The other ſtory is of <hi>S.

               <pb n="376" facs="tcp:2521:219"/>
Theſe 2. ſtories with many more are there not only related but publiquely allowed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by the whole <hi>Councel.</hi> How then can you Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſay that the <hi>Councel</hi> pretends nothing but a ciuil imbracing or kiſſing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any corporal ſubmiſſion to <hi>images?</hi> What greater ſubmiſſion can there bee then kneeling and proſtrating ones ſelfe vpon the ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a picture and ſpeaking and praying the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reto? but this is like the reſt of your ſayings.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Now for <hi>Valentia</hi> his words which you bring as if he did allow ſome idol-worship, it is manifeſt by them that he doth not allow any ſuch; but out of the words <hi>illicitis ſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrorum cultibus</hi> in S. <hi>Peter,</hi> taking the word <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulachrum</hi> in a good ſenſe, that is for the ſame as <hi>imago,</hi> as ſome <hi>ancient authors</hi> doe, and withall explicating his meaning in the vſe thereof, he ſaith it may ſeeme to be gathered out of <hi>S.

Neither doth your noting of the greeke word in the margent in proofe that <hi>S. Peter</hi> ſpeaketh of idol-worship auaile you.

               </gap> which ſignifieth <hi>ſpecies</hi> or <hi>forma.</hi> the ſeeming shape or beauty of a thing or perſon; but it is true that in the ſignification of words we muſt follow the eccleſiaſtical rule.

You proue the <hi>Safety</hi> of your doctrine aboue ours, becauſe <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith of the Scripture, that it is a moſt certaine and ſafe rule of beleeuing: and ſoe alſo ſay we: but what then? wherein is your faith more ſafe then ours? wee rely vpon the ſame ground of Safety as much, and more then you, how then are we leſſe ſafe? You ſay we rely vpon the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> which is but the authority of Man. Well grant for diſputation ſake it be but the

authority of man? if it were ſoe that we did leaue the authority of Scripture, &amp; ſticke onely to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> it were ſomewhat: then you might with ſome colour at leaſt ſay your way is more <hi>ſafe</hi> but now that we acknowledge and reuerence the authority of Scripture as much, nay much more then you, and ioyne the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewith the authority of the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> for expoſition of the ſame, though it should be but humane, how doth that diminish the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Scripture, or make it leſſe <hi>ſafe?</hi> A man in his right witts would thinke it would rather helpe then hinder. But what if this authority bee more then humane, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede it is, are we not then much <hi>more ſafe?</hi> I ſay nothing of vnwritten traditions which come not short for authority euen of the <hi>written word</hi> it ſelf, and which in two reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects ſeeme euen to ſurpaſſe it. One reſpect is that <hi>traditions</hi> extend themſelues to more things then the <hi>written word,</hi> and euen to the authorizing &amp; expounding of the <hi>ſame.</hi> For by <hi>tradition</hi> we receiue both the books of Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, &amp; vnderſtand the ſenſe thereof. The other, that they are leſſe ſubiect to the cutting kniues of haeretiques, which maketh them ſoe madde at them. For they cannot ſoe corrupt them, by putting in and out at their pleaſure as they can do the <hi>writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Word.</hi> And this indeede ſeemed the <hi>Safeſt way in Vincentius Lerinenſis</hi> his dayes: for he being deſirous to learne how he might diſcerne <hi>Catholique truth</hi> from haeretical falshood receiued
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:2521:224"/>
this anſweare from euery body as he ſaith: that if <hi>he would auoide the deceits and ſnares of Haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques and remaine ſound in faith, he should ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then his faith, two wayes, to wit, by the authority of the diuine Law and then by the Tradition of the Catholique Church.</hi> Whereby you ſee the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>antiquity</hi> concerning your <hi>Safety</hi> and <hi>Ours.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. Againe, you ſay it is ſafer to adore <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſitting at the right hand of his <hi>Father,</hi> then to adore the Sacramental bread. I aske how you proue it? for ſay I againe it is as dangerous to deny adoration to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Sacrament, as to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in heauen. For hee is as ſurely in the Sacrament as in heauen: the ſame Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que faith teaching vs both verityes: and to make you ſtudy a little, I may ſay in ſome ſort <hi>more ſure.</hi> For a man that would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious might deny <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſitt at the right hand of his <hi>Father,</hi> becauſe his <hi>Father</hi> hath neither right nor left hand. Wherein for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare you muſt fall to expound the Scripture and declare the meaning of that article which ſaieth it: and therein you shall find as much to doe, as we doe in expounding the words HOC EST CORPVS MEVM. Beſids doe not we adore him in heauen too, as well as you. How are you more ſafe then wee? Yea but you will ſay that we adore him on the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar too. It is true wee doe indeede: and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it doubtfull for the preſent, whether hee be there or noe, I aske wherein are you more
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:2521:224"/>
ſafe then we? if hee be not there, we are in danger of adoring him where he is not; if he be there, then are you in danger by not ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him where hee is: and it is as much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger not to adore him there; if he be there, as not to adore him in heauen. Wherein I ſay then are you more ſafe, though there were noe more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of beleife on our ſide then yours?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Thirdly you tell vs out of <hi>S. Aug.</hi> it is more ſafe to truſt wholy in <hi>God,</hi> then partly in <hi>God,</hi> partly in our ſelues. Soe we ſay alſo, and ſoe we doe. Wherein then are you more, or we leſſe ſafe? you ſay we truſt in our good works: it is true thus farre, that we teach that men by good worke may cooperate to iuſtification, meriting grace and glory, but that is but conditionally if a man doe ſuch good works: but yet we are farre from nourishing your confidence which you ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke of, which is not grounded ſoe much in that general principle of good works, as in the particular, that I for example doe theſe and theſe good works. Wherefore I ſay it is falſe in your ſenſe. For we doe not teach any man to perſwade himſelf, that he is iuſt and holy, but teach him to feare and doubt himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and in all his works according to the example of <hi>Iob. Verebar omnia opera mea. I did feare all my works:</hi> and if a man doe good works we teach that hee cannot be ſure, that they are good as they are done by him: that is that he doth them with ſuch a right intention and

by helpe of ſupernatural grace, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noe man can bee ſure of his owne iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to that alſoe of <hi>Iob.</hi>

And yet more we teach that he may fall againe, and looſe all his labour, which doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly diminish confidence of a man's ſelfe: ſoe as we leaue nothing for a man to truſt to of himſelfe, but that he muſt giue all to <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>S.

For my part I doe not ſee any reaſon for it, if you waigh the matter by reaſon, or by number, and authority of Doctors. Secondly neither of theſe two doth acknowledge any danger in our practice of <hi>one kind,</hi> but allow it for good and lawfull. For ſoe ſaith <hi>Hales, quia Chriſtus integrè ſumitur ſub vtra<expan>

               <pb n="388" facs="tcp:2521:226"/>
and ſoluing all the arguments of the Haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques againſt it. Soe as he acknowledgeth not your doctrine to be either ſafe or the ſame with his but a cleane different haereſy. For his is a Schoole opinion, not of the ſafety, but of the fruitfulnes of <hi>Communion in One or both kinds.</hi> Yours is an haereſy denying the ſufficiency of <hi>one kind,</hi> and vrging <hi>both,</hi> as a matter of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity for the integrity of the Sacrament, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> praecept, and denying alſo the authority of the <hi>Church,</hi> for diſpenſing therein.

And for <hi>Hales,</hi> beſids that he holdeth it very lawfull to communicate in <hi>one kind</hi> onely which is directly againſt you: I thinke a man that would goe about it might eaſily puzle you out of him: euen for ſoe much as pertaineth to the perfection of the ſpiritual fruit.<note place="margin">

Of this you ſay not a word: as neither doe your authors which you bring: for they ſpeake onely of the fruit which would redound to the people, which we grant to be greater when they communicate with the <hi>Prieſt</hi> then when not.

               <note place="margin">Panor. cap. Cum Plini. de Cler. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> yet farre otherwiſe, then you. For firſt he putteth the queſtion, whether the <hi>Church</hi> can giue way, that a Clarke may marry, as the <hi>Graecians</hi> doe: to which he anſweareth affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely: and this he ſaith is out of doubt with him, for ſoe much as pertayneth to them that are not obliged by tacite or expreſſe vow. And then he proueth it by reaſon, and sheweth that it is not <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> as we alſo grant. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon ſaith, that he doth not onely beleeue it to be in the <hi>Churches</hi> power; but he thinketh it
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:2521:227"/>
would be a wholeſome ſtatute for the good and ſafety of Soules, to lett ſuch as will, containe themſelues; and ſuch as cannot, to marry ſince experience (ſaith hee) teacheth the contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to follow of that Law of continency, ſeing men doe not now liue ſpiritually, nor are cleane but are ſpotted with vncleaneſſe to their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſinne. This is <hi>Panormitanes</hi> diſcourſe: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein firſt he acknowledgeth this whole matter to depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon the <hi>Churches</hi> authority; &amp; plainely sheweth by his diſcourſe that the law of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency doth bind: &amp; that it is a grieuous ſinne to goe againſt it. For which cauſe though his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion indeede be, that they should haue liberty to marry, yet he would not haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> marry againſt the Law ſtanding in force: but he would haue the Law taken away, which is a farre different doctrine from yours. Secondly he alloweth the obligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a Vow tacite or expreſſe, &amp; ſeemeth not indeede to ſpeake of ſuch as are ſoe tied: now with you &amp; your Miniſters, that is all one, wheter Chaſtity be vowed or not vowed: nay you diſallow all ſuch vowes. Thirdly he ſaith that where a man is bound by expreſſe or tacite vow the <hi>Pope</hi> cannot diſpenſe without a great and vrgent cauſe: which is againſt you, who require noe diſpenſation nor any ſuch cauſe. Fourthly he doth not ſpeake of ſuch as are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ordained: for they haue a Vow either expreſſe or tacite: but of thoſe that are to be ordained, whereas you would haue it as free for one as for another. Laſtly this opinion of <hi>Panormitane</hi> pertaineth not to the point of doctrine but
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:2521:228"/>
onely to the point of prudence or conueniency wherein he differeth from the common iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Catholiques and is therefore worthily noted by other Catholique Doctors. Soe as he concurreth not with you in opinion of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of the Marriage of <hi>Prieſts</hi> againſt the lawes of the <hi>Church</hi> but onely in this, that he would haue it made lawfull by taking away the contrary law.

<pb n="393" facs="tcp:2521:228"/>
and to render his Vowes to <hi>God,</hi> which the law of nature and moral honeſty requireth. Neither is it ſoe out of queſtion, that it is alwaies <hi>ſafer,</hi> euen in that kind of ſafety for a man to marry. For there is noe leſſe difficulty perhapps and conſequently danger for married men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with in the bounds of wedlock, then for <hi>Prieſts</hi> to containe themſelues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounds of perfect chaſtity: as both reaſon and experience teach; beſids that though Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſay it is better to marry then burne, yet he ſaith it is better not to marry ſuppoſing eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently that a man may forbeare Marriage &amp; yet not be forced to burne. Laſtly in our caſe, though the difficulty may be greater.

In which place I forbeare to note your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect manner of citing this authority. For who hearing Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> to make a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon betweene <hi>prayer vnderſtood</hi> and <hi>not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood</hi> and to ſpeake of a double fruit or <hi>refection,</hi> to wit, both of the affection and mind giuing that for a reaſon why the former is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.

For thus it followeth in him. <hi>Vnde cùm meliùs ſit refici quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ad affectum &amp; intellectum, quam quantum ad affectum ſolum, conſtat quod in oratione plus valet prophetiae donum, quam ſolum donum linguarum.

            <p n="9">9. But hauing cited the Latine thus lamely you tranſlate euen that which you haue cited as lamely. For you take the firſt and laſt part of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> his ſentence and put them in to English leauing out the middle in which he ſpeaketh of the <hi>double refection</hi> or <hi>fruit</hi> of both <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> and ſoe ioyne them together with the cauſal coniunction <hi>(for)</hi> of your owne placing not of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> his and putting in an <hi>And</hi> inſteed of an <hi>(Of)</hi> thus; <hi>fruite and refection</hi> inſteed of <hi>fruit of refection;</hi> which makes a very great alteration of ſenſe.

For as for the matter it is plaine <hi>S.

I ſay farther our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſy is not, whether it be better for men to ſay, their priuate deuotions in a language which they <hi>vnderſtand,</hi> then otherwiſe. For as for that we grant that it is better, as that note which you haue out of the <hi>Rhemes Teſtament</hi> acknowledgeth, but ſaying withall that the other is <hi>good:</hi> becauſe as <hi>S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> ſaith, it is better to <hi>refresh</hi> or <hi>feede</hi> both the <hi>vnderſtanding</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> then the <hi>will</hi> alone. For though the refection of the <hi>will</hi> be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal fruit, the <hi>will</hi> being the principal power in the exercize of <hi>prayer:</hi> and whereon the <hi>fruit</hi> of <hi>prayer</hi> doth neceſſarily and eſſentially depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, yet the other helpeth; but not ſoe, but that without it the <hi>prayer</hi> may be <hi>good</hi> and <hi>fruitfull:</hi> and therefore <hi>S. Thomas</hi> putteth the <hi>will</hi> before the <hi>vnderſtanding</hi> in this his ſentence. For if the <hi>will</hi> or <hi>deſire</hi> bee <hi>good,</hi> the <hi>prayer</hi> hath his <hi>fruit,</hi> though the <hi>vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding</hi> bee diſtracted: as when a man is diſtracted vnwillingly as it hapneth moſt frequently, and with the beſt men: in which caſe it were hard a man should be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the whole fruit of his <hi>prayer,</hi> without any fault of his. Now a diſtracted <hi>vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> is all one with a mind that vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not the words which he prayeth. Soe alſo with ſome proportion, or in ſome reſpect we ſay of <hi>publique prayer,</hi> that the people perhaps might reape ſome more fruit that way if they did <hi>vnderſtand</hi> the <hi>publique prayers:</hi> but the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion then is whether that fruite which may

come that way, can counteruaile the tenth part of the inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces which may happen by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <hi>publique prayers</hi> in a <hi>vulgar tongue:</hi> which are well noted in the <hi>Rhemes Teſtament</hi> there where you tooke out your note.

reading is as the Latine tranſlation which we follow hath it, whereto he ſaith there is more truſt to be had then to the Greeke books of <hi>S. Ignatius,</hi> which wee haue now. Whereof he bringeth this proofe that the teſtimonies cited out of him, as we find in the works of <hi>S.

Beſids that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proueth this euen out of the <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgians,</hi> becauſe they cite this very place at we doe.

by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpeaketh moſt plainely of the <hi>reall praeſence.</hi> Now for the later place I ſee not why you should be troubled at <hi>Ribera's</hi> words of <hi>Origen.</hi> For hee doth not ſpeake them by way of anſweare to any obiection (though you pleaſe to ſay ſoe, for your words are theſe: if we produce <hi>Origen;</hi> as if you did obiect ſome place out of him which you doe not:) or weakning his authority for his owne aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, for he writeth noe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſy, but onely by way of general aduice: he himſelfe as he ſaith hauing anciently beene well inclined towards <hi>Origen,</hi> for the fame of his learning; but finding him ſoe deepely cenſured by many holy <hi>Fathers</hi> and general iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the <hi>Church,</hi> he altered his opinion of him: this I ſay hee ſpeaketh onely by way of aduice being to comment vpon <hi>Malachias</hi> the <hi>Prophet</hi> and being there to treate which were the beſt interpreters of ſcripture without any reguard to any obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or controuerſy.

From whence is this tradition? for the Lord commanded vs to doe thoſe things, which are written, to which you ſay <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maketh anſweare that <hi>S.

For it is moſt true, that <hi>S.
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:2521:242"/>
Cyprian</hi> there writt in defence of rebaptization which he maintained, and becauſe he ſaw it could not be impugned by the written word; but onely by vnwritten tradition which <hi>S.

For proofe whereof I will but onely aske you whether you thinke <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> was then in an error or not? I preſume you will not deny but he was, otherwiſe you muſt grant that we may baptize ſuch as haue beene baptized in your <hi>Church;</hi> and are conuerted to <hi>ours,</hi> or that you muſt baptize ſuch of ours as fall to yours, becauſe you may ſay yours is noe haereſy, but rather ours. But whether ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer you ſay of theſe two, you I ſuppoſe will not, nor indeede can grant rebaptization: for it is contrary to your beleife &amp; practize. Well then, it is an error: Likewiſe this error is not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe maintained, but by denial of vnwritten tradition, and cannot be ouerthrowne but by holding them: and therefore it muſt follow of neceſſity that it is an error to deny <hi>tradition.</hi> Or thus, if this rebaptization be an error and that it follow of that principle of holding to the written word onely, then is that principle falſe. For it is an ordinary rule in Logicke, that if a concluſion be falſe or impoſſible, the premiſſe or principle from whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth muſt of neceſſity be falſe or impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and this rule is grounded vpon a certaine

not reiect or elude the <hi>Fathers:</hi> ſeing we haue our anſweares out of them: but to explaine the meaning of <hi>Salmeron's</hi> ſaying that the place of authority is weake, a little more, I will allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge S. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine</hi> his obiection and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare: he obiecteth that the ſcience of Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity cannot be argumentatiue:<note place="margin">1. <hi>p q.</hi> 1. <hi>ar.</hi> 8. <hi>and</hi> 2.</note> becauſe ſaith he it muſt argue out of authority or reaſon; not out of authority becauſe according to <hi>Boetius</hi> the place of authority is moſt weake: not out of reaſon becauſe then faith hath noe merit: to this he anſweareth that it argueth out of Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne authority; and ſaith that <hi>Boetius</hi> is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of humaine authority, which he alſo ſaith is the weakeſt kind of proofe. Soe as by this <hi>Salmeron's</hi> meaning is plaine not to reiect authority, but onely to preferre reaſon before humaine authority: as it is moſt plaine that it ought to be preferred. Beſids <hi>Salmeron</hi> giueth other anſweares as that he oppoſeth alſo a contrary multitude of Doctours; he oppoſeth the force of reaſon; he oppoſeth the conſent in a manner of the whole Church: concluding therefore that though ſome of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary part number a great many authors ſome 200. ſome 300. ſome but 15. yet the very nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bering shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to be few according to that ſaying <hi>Pauperis eſt numerare pecus, it is onely for a poore man to number his cattell:</hi> whereas a rich man's cattell or other wealth is not ſoe ſoone counted: inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating thereby that his authors are ſoe many that they are not to be numbred: and indeede

he hath almoſt as many Vniuerſityes, kingdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, commonwealths, religious orders and other communityes for him as the other ſide hath ſingle authors: By all which it is apparent that there is noe ſuch abſurdity in his ſaying as you would haue it ſeeme: for he ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not authority but preferreth onely grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter authority before leſſe, and reaſon befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re both: which noe man in his right witts can deny to be very good reaſon; where then was your reaſon Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> when you read <hi>Salmeron?</hi> it was ſtraying after ſome haereticall fancy.</p>

noe way receiue, of which ſome few that come to mind and are to be shunned by Catholiques, we thinke good to ſett downe heere: and ſoe there ſetteth them downe.

            <p n="3">3. But of this matter therefore I neede not ſay more it being euident by the light of nature that ſuppoſing there be a certaine rule of faith, to which all men muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme their thoughts, ſayings, and writings, and that the ſwaruing from it is a declining to haereſy, it pertaineth to the <hi>Catholique Romane Church</hi> (which muſt of neceſſity be this rule of faith.

But of this matter I ſaid ſomewhat in the beginning, and there being diuers learned treatiſes of this ſubiect particularly, I neede ſay noe more: but remitt ſuch as deſire ſatisfaction to them or

euen to the very rules ſett downe in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Index expurgatorius</hi> which are grounded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſoe good reaſon as I preſume noe indifferent man that readeth them can diſallow of them: I will not therefore ſtand particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to examine euery particular authour and iuſtify the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> for it would be both a long &amp; needleſſe labour. Onely I cannot omitt one authour called <hi>Bertram</hi> whom, to turne my ſpeech to you Sir <hi>Humphrey,</hi> me thinks you among all men liuing should neuer ſoe much as name, conſidering how much diſgrace you haue ſuſtained by tranſlating his booke and venturing your owne credit, and the credit of your Church vpon the faith thereof: and for him I anſweare that though his booke were proued plainely to containe good Catholique doctrine in the matter of <hi>tranſubſtantiation:</hi> yet becauſe it was obſcure in many places and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby gaue occaſion of erring: and indeede was of vncertaine authority, this onely being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that it hath beene in this laſt age pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by Haeretiques, we know not out of what records with ſome errours of their owne inſerted, therefore it might well be forbidden by the <hi>Inquiſition?</hi> but I ſay you should of all men liuing moſt labour to haue the memory thereof blotted out, therewith to obliterate your owne shame.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another thing which I am alſo to note is, concerning your coting of a <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> in this ſection; whereat I

according to that reading anſweare that triuiall obiection which your people ordinarily draw from thence againſt our adoration of <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> noe way excepting againſt the word, <hi>angelos,</hi> as if that were not the right reading, but shewing the ſenſe not to be any way againſt vs.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Is it not then shameleſſe dealing in you, to make your Reader beleiue that we corrupt the reading, left ſoe faire an euidence, to vſe your words, should be brought againſt vs; whereas we keepe the euidence ſoe faire and entire, in our beſt editions that were it not for them, you would not know what the true reading were; you knowing withall, that there is noe cauſe why we should goe about to chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge the word, which is nothing againſt vs: for we forſake not <hi>Chriſt;</hi> we acknowledge noe angels to be the framers of the world, nor chiefe mediators, nor that with out them we cannot haue acceſſe to <hi>God.</hi> Theſe are all haereticall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices, which we together with S. <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Laodicea</hi> deteſt.

But he breaking his faith, ſtole away the next night with a great ſumme of money whereof moſt did belong to the Church, carrying his concubine with him, and marrying her afterwards according to the cuſtome of Haeretiques became a Preacher and Miniſter in <hi>Holland.</hi> A little after endeauouring to reconcile the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Caluiniſts</hi> he writ a booke which he called <hi>Concord.</hi> in which he ſpeakes very bitterly of the <hi>Society</hi> of IESVS, calling the religious thereof <hi>Eſauits:</hi> he became preſently extreame wicked who ſeemed before endewed with angelical vertues and adorned with admirable ſweetnes of manners ſoe as by word and example he drew many to vertuous courſes; but now he is become ſoe vgly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold as is related and his life ſoe execrable in <hi>Holland</hi> that noe man can endure him.

by washing and ſpinning, euery man wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at her, and admiring the iuſt reuenge of almighty God vpon her: thus farre this moſt true and faithfull relation. Whereto I may adde one word more which is this that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Apoſtata Franciſcan running away to <hi>Breda</hi> when it was in the hands of the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and where this <hi>Boxhorne</hi> was at that tyme chiefe Preacher and being lodged in his howſe and in the next chamber to him and his Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he heard ſuch kind greeting betweene them that night the one curſing the other and imputing their apoſtaſy and future damnation to each other, this poore <hi>Frier</hi> repented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and therevppon came backe to his mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery and did penance, rather chooſing to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a little outward auſterity then to carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in the bottome of his ſoule ſuch an inward aſſured teſtimony and beleife of his aeternall damnation as he ſaw theſe two did. I might ſay more of the man's fine feates but there be bookes in dutch particularly of them as I heare: and ſoe I ſay noe more but that in this your learned <hi>Buxhorne</hi> whom you <hi>Sir Humphrey</hi> of <hi>Licentiate</hi> make a Doctor, as in all your other learned men that bleſſed Martyr <hi>F. Edmund Campian</hi> hit the right veyne and diſcouered the true cauſe of their apoſtaſy, when he told the Vniuerſity men, it was not any <hi>Charks</hi> or <hi>Hammers</hi> that held them backe: (as I may ſay alſo it was not any razing of euidences that made <hi>Boxhorne</hi> fall from his faith) but that
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:2521:257"/>
there were certaine <hi>Lutheran</hi> baites, where-with many of them were catched, which were. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, gloria, delitiae, veneres.

            <p n="3">3. But to lett that paſſe I likewiſe anſweare you for our ranking the bible in the firſt place of <hi>prohibited bookes,</hi> as you ſay we doe, that it is falſe and falſe againe. For it is not in the catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue of ſuch bookes; onely in the rules which concerne the <hi>index</hi> there is mention how the free vſe of vulgar tranſlations is not to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reg.</hi> 4.</note> but for the Latine vulgar tranſlation there is noe manner of reſtraint: though if the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re had beene, we might very well haue warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it by the authority of S. <hi>Hierome</hi> who did noe way admitt ſuch free vſe euen of the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne bibles; for hauing ſpoken largely and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly out of Scripture of the hardnes and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of ſcripture,<note place="margin">Ep. ad Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin.</note> he complaines that euery body did preſume to take, reade, and teach it before they learned it themſelues, diſallowing that euen ſuch as himſelf ſhould goe from ſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular learning preſently to the holy Scriptures, and interpret them at their pleaſure. S. <hi>Hierome</hi> then thought them hard, and was not ſoe free in allowing the reading of Scriptures as you are. For if he doe not allow the reading thereof in Latine to men and Scholars, how much leſſe
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:2521:259"/>
would he haue allowed it in Engliſh to wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Children? Beſides it is noe ſuch cryme to forbid the reading of ſcripture to ſome ſorts of people, as may appeare by this teſtimony of this holy <hi>Father,</hi> who in the ſame place alſo ſaith moreouer that the beginning of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> with the beginning and end of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> were not to be read by the <hi>Iewes,</hi> till they came to 30. yeares of age; which kind of forbidding is noe dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation but a great commendation of the holy ſcripture. And I call it but a kind of forbidding; for it is farre different, though you make it all one, from the forbidding of haereticall bookes. For theſe are forbidden as wicked, deteſtable, &amp; of themſelues dangerous; the other out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence and honor dew vnto them and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of the danger which may come by them not of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, but in reguard of the weaknes of the Reader, for want of neceſſary learning &amp; humility: both which a man that is to handle the Scriptures muſt come well prouided of.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For <hi>Cornelius Agrippa</hi> it maketh noe more matter what he ſaith, then what you ſay: for it is but aske my brother if I bee a theife? but it is fine that theſe fellowes cannot be inuited by a generall Councell with promiſe of all ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that can be deſired to come and propound what they can ſay out of ſcripture, or any way els, and yet when they come before a Iudge they will diſpute forſooth and by diſputing auoide the rigour of the Law. Indeede I cannot blame them; but if this ſeeme reaſon to you,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:2521:260" rendition="simple:additions"/>
why doe you deny Catholique Prieſts the like liberty of Diſputation? How often and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly haue they deſired it but could neuer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it? But neither euen in that caſe with vs are people denied any conuenient liberty: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any credit to be giuen to <hi>Cornelius Agrippa.</hi> For being a Magitian he may very well be ſaid to haue ſhaked hands with the Diuell the father of lies. Which you your ſelfe it ſeemes knowing and ſuſpecting that his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony would not paſſe for currant, you tell vs we ſhall heare our owne authors how they ſpeake of the Scriptures. For you tremble to ſpeake it as your words are. You tell vs ſome ſay they are dead characters, a ſhell without a kernel, a leaden rule, a wood of theeues, a ſhop of Haeretiques, imperfect, doubtful, obſcure, ful of perplexities, with many more epithets, which I let paſſe, theſe being of the very worſt and eſpecially the laſt 4. for which you allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge <hi>Leſsius,</hi> alleadging likewiſe for euery one of the reſt a ſeuerall authour. Whereto not to ſtand anſwearing euery one ſeuerally, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being the ſame of one and all; I ſay in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, that theſe things are ſpoken not of the Scripture, as it is in it ſelfe that is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of both words and meaning, as it we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re life and ſoule together, but of the bare words and letters onely which Haeretiques ſtill doe and euen haue abuſed as the Diuell himſelfe did to our <hi>Sauiour</hi> and in this ſenſe it is a wood of theeues.

Saint <hi>Hieromes</hi> words, which mee thinks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more adoe may eaſily anſweare your who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le argument for in them this holy <hi>Father</hi> ſayth as much or more as all thoſe Epithets which you bring out of our ſeueral authours put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather and withall ſheweth in what ſenſe they are to be taken. Soe as if you will ſay any more of this matter you muſt vndertake the quarrel againſt Saint <hi>Hierome.</hi> You may doe well alſo to note the very firſt words: <hi>Marcion, Baſilides &amp; caeterae haereticorum peſtes:</hi> among whom you haue your part.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Now for the 4. laſt epithets which you bring out of <hi>Leſsius,</hi> though they ſeeme not ſuch ſtrange termes, as ſome of the reſt, yet they are farr worſe and more derogatory from the holy Scripture if they be there as you ſay. I haue therefore more particularly examined him, whither he ſay ſoe or noe:<note place="margin">Leſs. Conſul. Quae ſit fides &amp;c. rat. <hi>11.</hi>
               </note> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas the words being all put downe by you heere as it were ſeuerall epithets, a man would haue thought they had beene all ſoe together in the authour himſelfe, I ſay firſt that there be neither any ſuch words lying togeather, nor any ſuch a part, nor any one word of thoſe, that I can find in that whole place or reaſon which I may call a chapter, for it is in manner of a chapter, much leſſe any of them vttered of the holy Scripture, though the whole Chapter or diſcourſe in that pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce be onely of the Scripture, and to proue
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:2521:262"/>
that it alone and of it ſelfe can not be a rule of faith. Which he proueth by many reaſons, one is becauſe by it we can not iudge of the <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelfe, and ſoe the very rule ſhall remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, which ought to be moſt certaine. And in this place he hath the word <hi>incerta,</hi> which though it ſignify the ſame with ſome of the words heere alleadged, yet is it not the ſame word. But yet heere <hi>Leſsius</hi> is farre from ſaying that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>vncertaine</hi> in it ſelf, that is, that the doctrine thereof is doubtfull: but onely that our rule wilbe vncertaine to vs or rather we vncertaine of the rule, becauſe we cannot know the Scripture by it ſelf. For example that this booke is true ſcripture, not ſuppoſitions, or feigned; or that this is the true meaning and ſenſe thereof. And this kind of vncertainty is noe derogation to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. <hi>Leſsius</hi> his ſecond reaſon is that, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a certaine rule which may be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated or fitted to contrary doctrines, as he ſaith, Scripture is by ſeuerall Haeretiques for eſtabliſhment of quite different opinions. His 3. reaſon is this: that cannot be a iudge, that cannot clearely determine on which ſide ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is giuen, but leaueth it ſoe, that the partyes may ſtill contend one affirming the ſentence to bee for him, another for him. And ſoe he ſaith is the ſcripture laying aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de the expoſition of the Church, and <hi>Fathers.</hi> Whereto he there bringeth alſo an example of two men, who going to law would admitt
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:2521:262" rendition="simple:additions"/>
noe other iudge but the Law booke; one brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging one Law cleerely for him, as he thinketh; the other another Law as cleerely for him in his iudgment, of which ſuite there could neuer be an end ſoe. Fourthly he sheweth by experience, that this rule of Scripture is not ſufficient for ending of Controuerſies: becauſe the <hi>Lutherans Caluiniſts</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> are alltogether by the eares, yet euery one alleadging Scripture for himſelfe. Laſtly he ſaith that the <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelf in noe place ſendeth priuate men to ſeach the Scriptures in doubtfull matters, but to the Church and Paſtours praeſiding therein.</p>
            <p n="7">7. This is the whole ſubſtance of <hi>Leſsius</hi> his diſcourſe in that place, wherein I would gladly heare what word there is derogating from the dignity of holy Scripture or any way condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it of imperfection, doubtfulnes, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity, and perplexity? ſome of theſe things might bee truely ſaid and in a good ſenſe, as the doubtfulnes or ambiguity in the ſame ſenſe that I ſpoke of the vncertainty, not in it ſelfe but to vſ-ward. But for the imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe that is a great matter with you, I abſolutely deny it: for neither doth any Catholique ſay either that, or any thing els from whence it may be gathered. For it is not all one to ſay, that it alone is noe ſufficient rule, and to ſay it is imperfect: for though you imagine that the all ſufficiency, or contayning of all things expreſly, is a neceſſary point of perfection, you are deceiued; for then would it follow, that

the ghoſpel of S. <hi>Mathew</hi> S. <hi>Marke</hi> and other particular books ſhould be imperfect, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> wherein he ſaith expreſly that all things are not written; neither if all the Scripture did containe all things in that manner as you would haue it, and ſoe were perfect in your ſenſe, yet would it not euen then be a ſufficient rule of faith of it ſelfe alone: for it would ſtill bee a booke or vriting, the very nature whereof doth not ſuffer it to be the ſole rule of fayth or iudge of controuerſies; for a Iugde muſt be able to ſpeake, to heare, anſweare &amp;c. whereas the nature of a booke or writing is as it were to leaue it ſelfe to be read, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by men; for in caſe two men should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it differently, the nature thereof doth not require that it should ſay whether of the two expoundeth it right.

And this may be anſweare ſufficient to the reſt of this Section which is nothing but a litle more of ſuch wiſe ſtuffe: for you tell vs we decline Scriptures as vnperfect, the fathers as counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:2521:263" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Proteſtants as haeretiques, our owne authors as erronious. Of which there is not one true word but this that we decline Proteſtants as haeretiques: for ſoe we doe indeede; but for the reſt it is moſt falſe. For what Catholique did euer decline the authority of our Schoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le Diuines or ancient fathers much leſſe call the one erronious or the other counterfect. Some one may haue ſtrayed a little from the common opinion of the reſt in ſome one particular point or perhaps haue beene corrupted by haeretiques, and ſoe we may decline that particular author in that particular point, but call him erroneous or counterfect we doe not: nay we giue you leaue to name that Father or Catholique Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, to whoſe iudgment we will not ſtand for trial of the controuerſies betweene you and vs: and if hee be for you in one, I will vndertake he shalbe againſt you in 5. or 10. others for that one. With what face then can you ſay we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline them? but becauſe I imagine you reflect moſt in this ſaying vpon this worthy worke of your owne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I leaue it to the conſideration of the indifferent Reader whether I haue ſoe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined one author either moderne or ancient; or whether I haue not shewed euery one which you haue brought to be quite againſt you.

concerning which I onely note that in this pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce you haue a new corruption.

For then it hath both the ends for which it was ordained. Now what doth this make for you Sir <hi>Knight,</hi> or againſt vs? as alſo that which followeth heere, to wit, that there is not any expreſſe mention among the <hi>ancien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s,</hi>
               <pb n="466" facs="tcp:2521:267"/>
where none did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate but the <hi>Prieſt</hi> alone, but onely coniectures: For noe more is there any expreſſe mention to the contrary, that noe <hi>Prieſt</hi> might, nor euer did ſay Maſſe without communicants, which vnleſſe you can shew in <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> you ſay nothing againſt vs: neither if you could shew it, should you therefore ſay any thing for your owne ſacrificeleſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; which hath noe affinity with our Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe: the eſſence whereof conſiſteth in being a Sacrifice and communion in being a participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame Sacrifice. Your Proteſtant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, being but a bitt of vnbleſſed bread and noe participation of Sacrifice, for you abſolutely deny all manner of viſible Sacrifice in the Church. Now for <hi>Bellarmines</hi> coniectures, it is true he giueth them noe other name but of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectures, but they are ſuch as may with great probability perſwade any indifferent man to conclude, that many times and I may ſay much more frequently the Prieſt ſaid Maſſe without communicants, then with them. And the leſt of them is ſuch, that if you had but halfe ſuch an one for any point you hold, you would vaunt it and triumph as if you had an vnanſwearable demonſtration. But be it ſoe or bee it not of ſome of the peoples communicating when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the Prieſt ſaid Maſſe: what maketh it to our purpoſe, which is whether it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſay Maſſe without communicants or not? they did not will you ſay, in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church: I aske what then? may not

I beleiue <hi>Sir Knight</hi> you will not like that ſoe well. If the peoples deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion grow ſoe cold as not to participate ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally of the ſacrifice, muſt the <hi>Prieſts</hi> grow ſoe cold alſo as not euen to offer Sacrifice, for his owne and the peoples ſinnes.

But what doe I in this diſcourſe heere? it is enough to shew that <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> doth not patronize you, nor weaken vs. The two places following touching <hi>prayer in a knowne tongue</hi> and <hi>Communion vnder both kinds</hi> in the primitiue Church are alſo anſweared before, &amp; are onely of the ſame kind of argument with this: the 6. place which is as if <hi>Bell.</hi> taught your two Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts is anſweared in two places vpon ſeueral occaſions;<note place="margin">Chap. <hi>9. §. 4</hi> fine. and ch. <hi>10.</hi> fine.</note> and in both is shewed your notorious corruption both of words &amp; ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Now for your two laſt teſtimonies, which you
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:2521:268"/>
brought not before, I shall heere examine. One you tell vs is touching <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>good works;</hi> of which ſay you it is <hi>Bellarmines</hi> confeſſion,<note place="margin">Bell lib. <hi>3.</hi> de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> that the Proteſtants doe not deny but that faith &amp; repentance are requiſite, that is a liuely faith and earneſt repentance: and that without them noe man can be iuſtified. To this I anſweare firſt that you propound the matter very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly and ignorantly, in ſaying thus touching faith and good works it is <hi>Bellarmines</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, &amp;c. not telling vs the particular contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſy, for which you bring this ſaying of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmines,</hi> there being more controuerſies then one betweene you and vs, as whither any thing be needful to iuſtification beſide faith? or what faith it is that iuſtifieth? and how and whither good works bee neceſſary or noe? and how they concurre? for there be all theſe things and more in queſtion betweene you and vs. And a man would haue thought by your general title of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>Workes</hi> it had beene in proofe of ſome of theſe, that you had brought <hi>Bellarm.</hi> But it is for noe ſuch matter, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the place cited handling a cleane differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t queſtion, to wit, whether a man can be certaine of his owne grace and iuſtice, that is whether he be in the grace and fauour of almighty God, or not: and for proofe that a man cannot be certaine thereof, he bringeth diuers places of Scripture, which imply a condition on our part; in our iuſtification as if we turne to God, if we ſeeke him in our whole hart, if we doe penance, if
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:2521:268"/>
we beleeue, if we doe his will &amp;c. God will turne to vs, forgiue our ſinnes and the like. Which condition ſaith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> we cannot be certaine whether we fulfill or not, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently we cannot bee certaine of our grace and iuſtice. And he ſaith theſe places are ſoe manifeſt, that our aduerſaries cannot deny ſomething to be requiſite on our parts. For though, ſaith he, they deny the remiſſion of Sinnes to depend vpon the condition of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes: or our penance, faith or other act to be the cauſe or merit of iuſtification, yet they grant them to be requiſite, and that without them a man cannot be iuſtified. This is <hi>Bellarmines</hi> diſcourſe wherein he doth neither confeſſe any good of your haeretiques nor any way allow or approue your ſaying, as you would make one thinke, but bringeth your owne confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions againſt you and euen by ſoe much as you confeſſe, though that be farre from enough, ouerthroweth another error of yours, to wit, your vaine confidence and certainty of your iuſtification. Now then <hi>Sir Humphrey</hi> is not this honeſt dealing in you, to take a word ſpoken by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> for one purpoſe, and to transferre it to another farre different? and againe in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of your ſelfe to alleadge thoſe words out of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> as his confeſſion which he allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth onely for yours, and to take it ſoe as if his allegation were an approbation or allowance of them whereas he bringeth them but in the nature of an obiection againſt your ſelues,
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:2521:269"/>
and there withall plainely declareth the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene your error and our faith that you will not haue faith or works to be any cauſe, or merit of iuſtification, nor iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to depend vpon works as vpon a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereas we teach all the contrary. Which though <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doe not ſtand to proue there, becauſe that was not a place for it, yet he plainely sheweth that to be his beleife.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſecond place of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> you ſay is touching <hi>iuſtification by faith onely;</hi> wherein you tell vs he concludeth with the reformed churches: ſaying that either a man hath true merits or hee hath not. If he haue not, he is dangerouſly deceiued; if he haue true merits he looſeth nothing by not reſpecting them, but putting his truſt in <hi>God</hi> onely. But in this againe as before, and euery where els, you ſtill <hi>Linde</hi> it egregiouſly. For heere you make as if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> did allow of your iuſtification by faith onely, whereas he confuteth the ſame largely and learnedly for 13.<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> de iuſtif. cap. <hi>1.</hi>

He concludeth againſt them: &amp; you tell vs he concludeth with them. And this place which you bring out of him is aboue 50. leaues,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:2521:269"/>
from that where he beginneth to treate of <hi>iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by faith,</hi> and is an argument for a farre different matter; to wit, that it is moſt ſafe for a man, though he may put ſome truſt in his owne good works, yet in reguard of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty he hath of his owne iuſtice, and danger of vaine glory; not to put any truſt in them, but all in <hi>God.</hi> This later part, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof there is noe controuerſy betweene vs and Proteſtants, Bellarmine proueth by the reaſon heere brought. Becauſe if he haue not true merits, he deceiueth himſelf: but if he haue, and yet truſt not in them, he looſeth nothing by not truſting in them. And what is all this good <hi>Sir Humphrey</hi> to your iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by faith onely? and conſequently all that you haue ſaid out of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in this ſection, to the antiquity, and ſafety of your doctrine, or the contrary of ours? not one word to any ſuch purpoſe on either ſide; and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore all is, but vaine bragging wherewith you conclude heerevpon, that our beſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned confeſſe that many principal points of their owne religion, yea many articles of faith are neither ancient, ſafe, nor Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que. Wherein you ſpeake ignorantly in diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing principal points of religion, from articles of faith, for though euery propoſition which is <hi>de fide</hi> be not an article of faith, yet euery principal point is, and therefore ſome giue that for the reaſon why we call a point an article, to wit, becauſe it is a principal

            </p>
            <p n="8">8. But to conclude this ſection you come with a ſaying of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> which will make all ſure: which is this, that as miracles were neceſſary before the world beleiued to induce it to beleiue, ſoe he that ſeeketh to be confirmed by wonders now, is to be wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at moſt of all himſelfe in refuſing to belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue what all the world beleiues beſids him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Out of which you would haue your Reader gather, that in that <hi>Father's</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Miracles haue ceaſed: and that whatſoeuer Catholiques ſpeake now of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles it but feigned: is not this your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sir <hi>Humphrey?</hi> ſure it is, for what els it ſhould bee I cannot imagine. Now to this I anſweare, that it is farr from Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> meaning as ſhall appeare. For he in this place reaſoneth with the <hi>Pagan,</hi> who did not beleiue the Miracles wrought by the firſt preachers of our faith: becauſe he ſaw not the like in his tyme: to which Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> anſweares that they were not ſoe needful
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:2521:275"/>
then as in the beginning, but yet proueth that there were ſuch wrought then: For how els ſaith hee came the world to beleiue? and now the world beleiuing there needeth noe miracle to make a man beleiue, the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the world being argument enough; and that therefore he were to bee wondered at, that would ſtand vpon Miracles for his beleife: and this is for vs. For ſoe ſay we, a man that ſhould ſtand vpon miracles to become a <hi>Catholique,</hi> the whole world of this age and for ſoe many foregoing ages, beleiuing and profeſſing that faith, were to be wondered at himſelfe: and we ſay againe that he is as much to be wondered at, that ſhal beleiue a new hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall religion not knowne before to the world, and contrary to the common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife thereof ſuch as <hi>Luther's</hi> or <hi>Caluin's</hi> is without Miracles. For all true religion muſt haue ſome teſtimony of <hi>Miracles</hi> from God in the beginning, till men beleeue: but men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiuing, they are not ſoe neceſſary. Soe as thus much as you haue ſett downe of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> his diſcourſe, is not againſt vs, but rather againſt your ſelfe. But now ſeeing you will needs ſpeake againſt <hi>Miracles</hi> and that out of Saint <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Let vs ſee what els there is in this place againſt or for Miracles.

            <p n="1">1. THis ſection is nothing but a little of the <hi>Knight's</hi> owne natural language; and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore will ſoone be anſweared. He beginneth with a ſaying of <hi>Coſterus,</hi> that a man dying a <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> cannot be ſaued: Wherevpon he falleth in to a great rage againſt the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and telleth vs there is a Woman, a Church, a Citty, which reigneth ouer the <hi>Kings</hi> of the <hi>earth,</hi> and hath <hi>multitudes</hi> of <hi>nations</hi> at <hi>her Command,</hi> but he thanks <hi>God</hi> his Church is not ſuch an one: Neither doe <hi>Proteſtans</hi> as he ſaith account <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſality</hi> of <hi>nations,</hi> and <hi>people</hi> to be a marke of their Church, and from thence he falleth to reckon vpp diuers particular points of his Churches doctrine, as diſclayming of <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, Communion</hi> in <hi>both Kindes,</hi> reading of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and bringing a place of Scriptures
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:2521:279"/>
for each of theſe, he asketh very rhetorically after euery one whether they be accurſed for holding them: and on the other ſide asketh whether we can be bleſſed that <hi>forbid marriage,</hi> &amp; <hi>meates,</hi> that <hi>haue prayer</hi> in an <hi>vnknowne tongue, adore images, adore Saints, adore</hi> the <hi>elements</hi> of <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine, wee</hi> that <hi>add traditions</hi> to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and detract from <hi>God's commandments</hi> and <hi>Chriſt's inſtitution</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Which diſcourſe of his being ſoe foolish as it is, a man may thinke it folly for mee to ſtand anſwearing particularly; therefore I anſweare briefly and in general, firſt that though it take vpp half his ſection yet it is wholy from his purpoſe which he pretends by the title of his chapter, which is to anſweare our obiection. Secondly I anſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, that for thoſe things which he obiecteth vnto vs, they are all anſweared before, and proued ſome falſe for the things wherewith he chargeth vs; all abſurd if we conſider the proofs of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which he bringeth: for example he telleth vs we forbid marriage and meats, both which are moſt groſly falſe. For how many Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques be there in England men and women mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried? and what meate is there that Catholiques are forbidden to eate in dew tyme and ſeaſon? is it all one to forbid marriage to ſome men, to wit, ſuch as haue voluntarily promiſed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and ſome meates at ſome tymes; all one I ſay as to forbid marriage and meates, neither marriage nor meats being forbidden in theſe caſes as ill in themſelues, in which ſenſe onely
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:2521:279"/>
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> termeth it <hi>the doctrine of Diuels,</hi> but for higher ends. But to make him yet a little more capable of this anſweare I will vrge him with one ordinary inſtance, which is this. I preſume his <hi>Father</hi> had ſome apprentice bound not to marry during his apprenticeſhip I would then know of him whither his father in that caſe did <hi>forbid marriage</hi> and teach the <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>Diuels?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Againſt <hi>prayer</hi> in an <hi>vnknowne tongue</hi> he ſaith, it is written: <hi>with men of other ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues and other lipps will I ſpeake vnto this people, and ſoe they shall not heare mee:</hi> and in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſaith, <hi>it was a curſe at the building of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel for them that vnderſtand not what was ſpoken.</hi> But by this alleadging of Scripture a man may ſee what a good thing it is to haue it in the vulgar tongue for euery man to read and abuſe it at his pleaſure, when ſuch a right learned man as this <hi>Knight</hi> doth ſoe ſtrangely apply it. He would make men beleiue <hi>Eſay</hi> the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſpoke againſt Latine in this place but the man is quite wide of his marke: but it is enough for him that there is mention of a ſtrange ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue there: for as for the ſenſe he careth not, or rather his reading reacheth not to the meaning of the place, which is but this: that whereas the people laughed at the <hi>Prophets</hi> that came to them with commands from God repeating their words ſcoffingly <hi>manda, remanda,</hi>

thoſe words nor follow the good counſel which he gaue, he would ſpeake another word vnto them, that they should fall &amp; be catched, crushed and carried into captiuity and there heare a language which they did not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand: this is the plaine and literal ſenſe of the <hi>Prophet.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> indeede vſeth it in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſenſe to perſwade the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that <hi>prophecy</hi> is to be preferred before <hi>tongues:</hi> becauſe as he ſaith <hi>the guift of tongues is a ſigne for infidels:</hi> that is, to ſpeake to infidels, for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion; but <hi>prophecy,</hi> that is exhortation or interpretation, is for the faithful or thoſe that beleiue already.

            <p n="4">4. But now to come to the matter which he purpoſeth in this ſection which is to anſweare our argument, that it is <hi>ſafer</hi> for a man to take the <hi>way</hi> of the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> then the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,</hi> becauſe euen <hi>Proteſtants</hi> agree with <hi>Catholiques</hi> in this that they may be ſaued in their religion, and <hi>Catholiques</hi> deny that <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> can be ſaued: this argument the <hi>Knight</hi> denieth, being ſory for his part that a charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinion on the Proteſtants part, ſhould gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue any <hi>Romaniſt</hi> occaſion to liue and dye in the boſome of that Church; therefore he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreteth
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:2521:281"/>
that ſaying to be meant onely of ſuch as by inuincible ignorance, reſigne their eyſight to their Prieſts &amp; Paſtours: which men if they hold the articles of Chriſtian beleife, without oppoſition to any ground of religion, and liue for outward things in the vnity of the <hi>Church,</hi> ſuch men he ſaith liuing <hi>Papiſts</hi> and dying Proteſtants in the principal foundation of <hi>Faith,</hi> may find mercy; becauſe they did it ignorantly. But ſuch <hi>Papiſts</hi> he ſaith, as liue in States and Kingdomes, where they may co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to knowledge of the truth, and will not; theſe men dye in their ſinnes; though yet agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne he a little temper the rigour of this doome, in ſaying he will not iudge their perſons though he pronounce their doctrine ſoe dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, as that if he had 10000. ſoules, he would not venture one of them in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Faith</hi> and <hi>Church.</hi> For which he taketh God and his holy Angels to witneſſe: and then concludeth very pathetically thus. Farr be it from the thoughts of good men to thinke the points in controuerſy betwixt them and vs, to be of an inferiour alloy, as that a man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue this way or that, without perill of his ſaluation. And then tells vs the freſh bleeding wounds and ſufferings of holy men and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs in his Church, doe ſufficiently witneſſe the great danger in our religion, and difference betwixt vs: and that we may know that the beſt learned of his Church, were farr from graunting ſaluation to any Papiſt, liuing and
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:2521:282"/>
dying in the profeſſion of the now <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Faith,</hi> he bringeth a ſaying of <hi>Whitaker</hi> who would haue vs take it vpon his word, that <hi>in heauen there is not one Ieſuit, nor one Papiſt to be found:</hi> this is the <hi>Knight's</hi> whole diſcourſe in the ſecond part of his ſection.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Whereby vpon examination it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, hee is as well redd in his owne authors, as in our <hi>Schoolmen</hi> and <hi>Fathers.</hi> And to begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne with him, he is ſorry the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould giue any man encouradg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to dye a Papiſt. But by his leaue, this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion doth not proceede from charity; but from euidence of truth as all teſtimony from an enemy doth. But whether it be charity or not, this <hi>Knight</hi> will none of this charity: and therefore he ſaith that this is meant one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſome ignorant people, whoſe ignorance may excuſe them; but yet euen theſe men though they liue <hi>Papiſts,</hi> they muſt dye Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in the principall foundation of that <hi>Faith.</hi> This is good ſtuffe <hi>Papiſts</hi> may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in their religion; but yet they muſt dye Proteſtants? very right Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> where haue you learned this theology that a man may be ſaued in one religion, yet ſoe as he muſt dye in another: this is a new conceit ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard of before that a man may bee ſaued in a religion but ſoe as not to dye of it: and heere a man might aske at great many pretty queſtions as what foundation of <hi>Faith</hi> that is, that they muſt dye in, what articles of <hi>Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi>
               <pb n="499" facs="tcp:2521:282"/>
and <hi>Chriſtian beleife,</hi> what grounds theſe are that may not be oppoſed? all theſe had beene neceſſary things to be expreſſed in ſuch a ſingular treatiſe as this of yours: which muſt forſooth beare the name of a <hi>SAFE WAY leading men to true Faith.</hi> And why alſo a man that holdeth the <hi>Apoſtles Creede</hi> and other things common to Catholiques and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, not forſaking the <hi>Catholique church</hi> and indeed not knowing any thing els (for heere you ſpeake of a Catholique in a Catholique countrey where it is to be ſuppoſed, the name of a Proteſtant or other heretique is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne:) why I ſay ſuch a man ſhould be ſaid to dye a Proteſtant, in the principal points of his faith I ſee not. For why? doth the <hi>Apoſtles Creede</hi> belong more to you then to vs? had we it from you or you from vs? nay if I would ſtand vpon it, I could ſhew you not to beleiue a right in any one article thereof. Whereof he that liſteth to know more may looke in <hi>Poſſ. bibl. ſelect. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 32. Nor doe I ſee what that meaneth that you ſay of men that liue for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things in the vnity of the Church, where they dwell. For if it be ſoe that they may make ſhew of one thing outwardly, and meane an other inwardly, as I ſee not what you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meane els, then I ſay it is the moſt damnable &amp; dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diſſimulation of all other &amp; the moſt ſure way not to be ſaued in any religion. For neither the outward profeſſion of a religion without the inward beleife, nor inward beleife with
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:2521:283"/>
an outward contrary profeſſion can ſaue a man. What then is it you would ſay? a man may ſee you are in ſtraights: faine you would not goe abſolutely againſt that, which many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants ſay, that a Catholique may be ſaued in his religion, yet that will not ſtand neither with your owne iudgement as it ſeemeth nor bitter ſpeeches which you haue ſpoken of the Catholique church as calling it <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Seate of <hi>Anti-chriſt</hi> and ſuch like; nor drift of your booke which is wholy to draw men away from the Catholique faith: and therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re you would faine find ſome ignorant people who ſhould be Catholiques and noe Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, liue Catholiques and dye Proteſtants, in outward ſhew Catholiques, in inward beleife Proteſtants. Which are two great and groſſe abſurdities and withall doe not ſerue the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. For in neither of theſe two caſes is that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition verified, that a man dying a Papiſt may be ſaued, for he doth not dye a Papiſt. Neither can that ignorance which you ſpeake of, alleadging the place of ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaue men, noe more then it could doe him, who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſhould neuer haue found ſuch mercy as to be ſaued, had he not firſt found the mercy, to be drawne out of that his ignorance, wherein he was. This I doe not ſay, that it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely impoſſible to find one ſoe inuincibly ignorant as may not be ſaued without a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and particular profeſſion of the <hi>Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Faith</hi> and abrenunciation of the <hi>Proteſtant,</hi>
               <pb n="501" facs="tcp:2521:283"/>
but I ſay it is a metaphyſical and morally impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible caſe. For how shall a man receiue pardon of his ſinnes, be enabled to walke the way of God's commandments while he liueth, or be armed againſt the combats of the Deuil at his death, without receiuing the Sacraments of the Church, which is a ſufficient profeſſion of faith, wholy diſtinguiſhing him from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant or any other ſect. Therefore the <hi>Knight's</hi> chiefe anſweare to the argument is a plaine denial that a Papiſt can be ſaued, eſpecially in England or in any Proteſtant State, where there is a courſe taken to bring him to the knowledge of the contrary; though yet he doe not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce damnation on our perſons, as he ſaith we doe on his. But wherein doe we pronounce damnation vpon their perſons more then he on ours: he and others of his opinion ſay our doctrine is damnable, and conſequently that noe man can be ſaued by it; we ſay the ſame of his doctrine, and that noe man can be ſaued by it for this or that particular man we doe not take vpon vs to giue any abſolute iudgment, but that we leaue to <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. But now for that which he ſaith of vs, that we cannot be ſaued, and that it is farre from the thoughts of good men, to thinke the points of controuerſy betweene Catholiques and Proteſtant to be of an inferiour alloy ſoe as a man may hold either way without peril of ſaluation, I will appeale onely to his owne men, and to ſuch as I preſume he will not
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:2521:284"/>
deny to be good men, at leſt chiefe men of his owne Church. For the points therefore in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſy as <hi>frewill, prayer for the dead, honouring of reliques, reall preſence, tranſubſtantiation, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in one or both kinds, worshipping of images, the Popes primacy,</hi> his being <hi>Vicar of Chriſt</hi> and <hi>head</hi> of the <hi>Church, auricular Confeſsion,</hi> and the like they are all acknowledged ſome by one, ſome by another, not to be material points, ſoe as a man may without perill beleiue either way and one maine point, to wit, the <hi>real praeſence</hi> is ſaid by ſome to be but as it were the grudging of a little ague.

And which is ſpecially to be noted, whereas a mayne reaſon why our <hi>Knight</hi> is loth to yeild the points in controuerſy to bee matters of indifferency, is becauſe the fresh bleeding wounds of the Martyrs of his Church witneſſe the daunger of our religion; among theſe authours there is one <hi>Iohn Frith</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Foxian</hi> martyr who acknowledgeth that the matter touching the ſubſtance of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament bindeth noe man of neceſſity to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation or damnation whether he beleiue it or not; and the like the ſame man alſo ſaith of <hi>prayer for the dead,</hi> which <hi>Mr. Iohn Fox</hi> relating and not diſapprouing he is to be preſumed to approue and ſo both the Martyr <hi>Frith</hi> and <hi>Fox</hi> the martyr-maker, whoſe authority me thinks should be more worth then an hundred of his Martyrs, are againſt our <hi>Knight;</hi> and notwithſtanding all their bleeding wounds and ſufferings will giue him leaue to thinke his points of controuerſy to be of an inferiour alloy: and many of them not onely ſoe but euen abſolutely condemne his very beleife and doctrine, as a man may ſee fully proued in the <hi>examen</hi> of <hi>Iohn Fox his Calender</hi> to which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him contenting my ſelf with one onely Martyr whom I preſume our <hi>Knight</hi> will acknowledge for a great one, to wit,<note place="margin">V.

controuerſy are not of ſuch neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: whoſe number and authority though perhaps it be not ſufficient to reforme your iudgment, yet to vs it is ſufficient to ground this argument, that ſince Proteſtant <hi>Doctors</hi> make noe doubt but we may be ſaued in our faith, and noe <hi>Doctor</hi> of ours ſaith ſoe of your faith, it is out of doubt the <hi>Safer way</hi> to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace ours: the force of which argument you goe not about to auoide otherwiſe then by denying that to be the opinion of learned <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> which being proued to be ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly, the argument ſtill hath his force and the more becauſe you cannot anſweare it.

<pb n="509" facs="tcp:2521:287"/>
with putting the caſe we may be ſaued, and then laying for a ground that it is <hi>Safer</hi> to perſiſt in that Church where both ſides agree, then where one part ſtandeth ſingle in opinion; adding withall, that if he make not good the title of his booke, to wit, that he is in the <hi>Safer way,</hi> hee will reconcile himſelf to the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> &amp; creepe vpon all fower to his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. And then falleth to proue it in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that becauſe Both agree ſaith hee in the beleife of heauen and hell, and that we ſtand ſingle in the beleife of <hi>Purgatory</hi> and <hi>Limbus puerorum,</hi> we are not therefore in ſoe <hi>Safe</hi> a <hi>way:</hi> ſoe of the <hi>merits</hi> and <hi>Satisfactions</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> all agree, that men are to be ſaued by them, but wee ſtand ſingle in the addition of the <hi>Saints merits</hi> and our <hi>owne ſatisfaction:</hi> and ſoe forward of the <hi>number</hi> of <hi>Sacraments, images prayer to Saints,</hi> &amp; the like: Which is the whole diſcourſe of this Section.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whereto I anſweare firſt that, that his ground of <hi>Safety,</hi> which he thinks he taketh from <hi>Catholiques,</hi> is folish, impertinent, and without ſenſe, as ſe ſetteth it downe. For thus he ſaith it is the <hi>Safer way</hi> to perſiſt in that Church, where both ſides agree, then where one part ſtands ſingle by themſelues in opinion. For I would know what Church is that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein there be two ſides to agree or diſagree? or what Church that is that doth not ſtand ſingle in opinion by it ſelf, if it be a Church of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent faith as we ſpeake heere of a Church, a
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:2521:288"/>
Church muſt haue vnity, it being a company of men all profeſſing the ſame faith and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: therefore it is plaine there is no ſenſe in this principle of his, as it is his, or as he putteth it downe: but as the Catholiques put it, it hath very good ſenſe, thus: that whereas there be ſeueral profeſſions and churches, the queſtion being which of theſe is the <hi>safer way,</hi> we <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques</hi> ſay the <hi>Catholique church</hi> is the <hi>ſafer way</hi> and this we proue becauſe not onely we our ſelues ſay it, adding withall that all our <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours</hi> haue beene ſaued therein and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may doubtleſſe be ſaued in it as they were; but alſo for that our very enemyes who are of a different profeſſion graunt we may be ſaued therein. But as for the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> noe man ſaith they can be ſaued in that faith, but onely themſelues. Whereby it is plaine that our is the <hi>ſafer way;</hi> for both ſides agree in the poſſibility of ſaluation among vs, and both ſides doe not ſoe agree in poſſibility of ſaluation among them. But though his principle haue no ſenſe as he putteth it, yet becauſe I ſee by his enſuing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe what he would be at, I come to that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. His meaning then is this, that it is <hi>ſafer</hi> to hold thoſe points of doctrine onely which both ſides hold then thoſe wherein they differ; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in them both ſides agree, and in theſe one ſide ſtandeth ſingle by it ſelf: and the holding of thoſe former points, our <hi>Knight</hi> counteth all one, as to perſiſt in a Church where both ſides agree. But he is much deceiued for the holding of thoſe points alone, doth not make a man of
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:2521:288"/>
any Church at al. For a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be of any Church, he muſt hold all the points that are taught of Faith in that Church, &amp; be vnited with thoſe of the ſame profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in <hi>Sacrifice</hi> alſo &amp; <hi>Sacraments,</hi> which are things eſſentiall to a <hi>Church.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holding of thoſe points wherein both ſides agree preciſely, neither make a man Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique, nor Proteſtant. But to be a <hi>Catholique</hi> a man muſt beleiue all thing els, whatſoeuer the <hi>Catholique church</hi> teacheth as neceſſary to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and to be a Proteſtant beſides the beleife of thoſe things wherein we agree, he muſt ſtand to the deniall of thoſe which are in controuerſy betweene <hi>vs.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. In which caſe I would aske him whether he doe not ſtand ſingle as well as wee, by affirming of what we deny, or denying what we affirme, or rather whether he and his church be not ſoe much more ſingle then we, as they haue not one on their ſides for euery millio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which we haue, &amp; haue had on ours.

Soe as in this Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> hath alſoe altered the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; for whereas the queſtion was of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in controuerſy which ſide was truer he hath altered it thus; whether the things in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſy or out of controuerſy be <hi>ſafer.</hi> Which is but a ſlippery cunning tricke of his, and which will not ſerue his turne to make good the title of his booke.

we are vpon euen termes with him, thus farre that he is as well ſingle in thoſe things wherein he diſſenteth from vs, as we in thoſe wherein we diſſent from him; though in this we be <hi>Safer</hi> that his men confeſſe wee may be ſaued holding thoſe things wherein we differ from them; and noe man of ours holdeth that they can be ſaued holding obſtinately whatſoeuer they differ from vs in. Soe as euen by this is anſweared all this maine argument whereof the <hi>Knight</hi> was ſoe confident as therevpon to ventute his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vpon all fower to his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> for a pardon; to creepe vpon all fower indeede, is a very fitt gate for men ſoe deuoid of reaſon as to make ſuch diſcourſes and vſe ſuch malicious inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as if men vſed to creepe vpon all fower to the <hi>Pope.</hi> But good Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſince you talke ſoe much of creeping, and like it ſoe well you may remember that it is the proper punishment of pride as you may ſee in <hi>Nabuchedonozor</hi> whoſe <hi>Pride</hi> which he tooke in his great citty <hi>Babylon</hi> ſeemeth farre short of that which you take,<note place="margin">

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S this treatiſe was vnder the print, I came to vnderſtand of ſome few thinges, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof I could not omitt heere to giue thee notice. One is of another anſweare newly come forth to this booke of <hi>Sir Humphrey Lind's</hi> which at firſt made me demurre whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I should goe forward with this of mine or not, as well for ſauinge of charge, as alſo becauſe it might now ſeeme needleſſe. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding by the aduiſe of friends I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to goe thorough with it: for as they tould me, it being brought ſoe neere an end, the charge would be little more, and as for the needledneſſe they ſaid it was neither needleſſe nor new, to haue ſeueral anſweares to the ſame booke: for that the ſame thing might be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweared ſeueral wayes, and the iudgments and affections of men being very diuerſe, one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare might be more for one man's guſt, and another for another's. Beſides that this <hi>knight</hi> hauing ſoe triumphed with his ſeueral edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:2521:294"/>
it could not ſeeme altogether needleſſe for him, to haue ſeueral anſweares: that men might ſee there haue not wanted many that could haue anſweared him if they had thought him worthy of anſweare. For theſe reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue beene induced notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that other anſweare to lett this of myne ſee light.</p>
            <p>Another thing is concerning a fourth edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Sir Humphrey's SAFE WAY,</hi> which I neuer heard of, till now that this anſweare of myne was more then halfe printed; at the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whereof, I was in minde againe to let all alone. For hauing vſed onely the third edition, and a fourth coming out, reuiſed at it ſaith by the author, I preſumed there would be ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable change or addition, the examination and anſweare whereof, would require longer tyme then I was now willing to ſpare, &amp; a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter place then the end of a booke. But finding meanes to get this 4. edition &amp; examining it, I found by the number of the pages of the whole booke, (there being but one onely more in the new then the old &amp; the very lines of euery pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge in a manner agreeing) that there could be nothing of moment more in the later then in the former. Wherefore I reſolued heere to add the anſweare of whatſoeuer was added or cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, leſt he might except that his laſt corrected edition was not anſweared, or perhaps that he was falſely charged, if there were ſometing left out of the fourth which was in the third editio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>The whole difference then of the two edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:2521:294"/>
is in theſe places following: firſt whereas in the third edition in his 9. ſect. he had made 8. paragraphes, treating 8. particular points of doctrine in this 4. edition he hath made nine, diuiding the ſecond, which was <hi>of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord's ſupper</hi> (theſe are the words of his title) <hi>and the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation</hi> into two §§. making this the title of the ſecond §. <hi>The Sacrament of Baptiſme and the Lord's ſupper;</hi> and this the title of the third <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> though he haue not one word either more, or otherwiſe, in theſe two new §§. then he had before in that one wherein he playeth much like a man, that would change a ſhilling into two ſix-pences onely to ſeeme to haue more money, becauſe he had more peeces. And as for his Baptiſme why he ſhould put it in the title at all I ſee not: for all that he ſaith of it in either place is onely this that he thinketh noe man ſoe blinde or ſtupid as to deny it to be the ſame ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tially with that of the Primitiue church, which is a goodly catch to make ſoe faire a title for.</p>
            <p>The ſecond place is pag. 174. in the 5. §. of the third, and 6. §. of the fourth edition which is of communion in both kinds: where hauing ſaid that a man would gladly know what the reaſons were, why the Romane church did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid communion in both kinds, and withall cited <hi>Gerſon's</hi> treatiſe in the margent, which as he there acknowledgeth ſhewes the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, I there reprehended him for it, as may be ſeene heere chap. 9. §. 5. n. 7. Now as it ſeemes
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:2521:295"/>
reflecting vpon his owne abſurdnes therein, in his 4. edition he doth not ſay that <hi>Gerſon</hi> shewes the cauſes as he ſaid before but declares them himſelf out of <hi>Gerſon,</hi> ſaying they were theſe, to wit, The length of lay mens beards; the lothſomneſſe to drinke after others; the coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and difficulty of getting wine; the froſts in winter; the flies in ſommer; the burden of bearing; the daunger of ſpilling, and the peoples vnworthines to equall the Prieſts in receiuing in both kinds. Thus farre are <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's</hi> words as he citeth them in a different letter, continuing the diſcourſe himſelfe in this manner. And thus for longe beards and vnſweet breathes, for a litle paines and noe great charges, for froſts in winter and flies in ſummer, I ſay for theſe and the like Catholique conſiderations pretended in the Councel of Conſtance, the church of Rome abolished Chriſt's inſtitution, and laide <hi>Anathema</hi> vpon all that at this day maintaine the contrary. Soe <hi>Sir Humphrey</hi> prouing himſelf as imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in ſetting downe <hi>Gerſon's</hi> diſcourſe lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ridiculouſly, as he did before in not ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it downe at all: for better declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof I shall heere put downe <hi>Gerſon's</hi> words as they lye,<note place="margin">Gerſ. tract. de com. laico. ſub vtraque ſpe.</note> which are theſe. <hi>Vnde dicunt plurimi Theologi</hi> &amp;c. Wherefore very many diuines ſay, that the cuſtome of not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating the layity vnder both kindes, eſpecially ſince the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the faithfull hath beene lawfully and reaſonably introduced, &amp; this for the auoidind
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:2521:295"/>
of manifold daunger of irreuerence, and ſcandal in the receiuing of this moſt bleſſed Sacrament. The firſt daunger is in ſpilling; the ſecond in carriage from place to place; the third in the fowling of the veſſels which ought to bee hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, &amp; not handled or touched ordinarily by lay-people, and much leſſe ought the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wine to be ſold in shops as it is ſaid to be with ſuch men (that is the Bohemians whoe ſtood for the vſe of the chalice;) the fourth is in the longe beards of lay-men, the fifth in the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping thereof for the ſicke, becauſe in the veſſel it may become vinager, and ſoe the blood of Chriſt would ceaſe to be there, being neither to be receiued nor to be conſecrated a new with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Maſſe, and ſoe it might come to paſſe that pure vinager may come to be giuen in ſteed of the blood of Chriſt: beſids that in ſummer flies would breede, how cloſe ſoeuer the veſſel should be shut: ſome tymes alſo it would putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, or become as it were noiſome to drinke, and this reaſon is very efficacious; as alſo for an other reaſon, when many had drunke before. And we may aske in what veſſel ſoe great a qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tity of wine should be conſecrated at Eaſter, for ten or twenty thouſand perſons? the ſixt harme is in the coſtlineſſe of wine, at leſt in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places where there is ſcarce wine found to celebrate withall, &amp; in other places where it is not to be had but at a deare rate: beſide there would be daunger of congeling or turning to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee. Againe there would be daunger of creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:2521:296"/>
and this many wayes. Firſt that the dignity of the layity is as great in the receiuing of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament as that of Prieſts. Secondly that ſoe to doe was euer, and is a matter of neceſſity, &amp; ſoe all that haue done, and doe thinke, practiſe or teach otherwiſe haue perished and doe perish; and generally all, as well clarks, Doctors and Prelats whoe haue not oppoſed themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch a cuſtome by word and writing, and that they haue peruerted the ſcripture: Thirdly that the vertue and force of this Sacrament is not more principally in the conſecration then in the receiuing. Fourthly that the church of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me doth not thinke rightly of the Sacraments, nor is heerein to be imitated. Fiftly that general Councels and particularly this of Conſtance haue erred in faith and good manners. Sixtly it would many wayes be occaſion of ſedition and shiſmes in our part of Chriſtendome, as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience sheweth in Bohemia. Hitherto are the words of <hi>Gerſon:</hi> by the onely reading and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring whereof, it will eaſily appeare how badly Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> hath delt as well in culling out ſome few reaſons of leaſt force, as alſo in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering them not in the author's phraſe as they lye, but in a certaine ridiculous fashion of his owne: for firſt he mentioneth not the two maine heads which containe all the reſt and are chiefly to be reguarded in the adminiſtration of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to witt, irreuerence and ſcandall: then among the daungers of irreuerence he leaueth that, which may moſt eaſily happen, and cannot

indeede be well auoided, to wit, that with longe keeping as when it is kept for the ſicke, the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of wine would turne into vinager; that it would otherwiſe corrupt, &amp; become noyſome, which <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſeemeth to count his chiefe reaſon for he ſaith of it that it is a very efficacious one Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> alſo leaueth out that other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that either the veſſels wherein it is kept muſt be let to grow very fowle, or be touched and handled by lay people: both which are contrary to the reuerence dew to this holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: he leaueth out that point of ſcandal in ſelling of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated wine, to ſaue the credit of his bretheren of Bohemia, whoe vſed ſoe to doe. He leaueth out the manifold daungers of ſcandal by mis-beleif, to wit, that heereby men might come to beleeue that it were a matter of neceſſity; that heereby they might come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne all that haue taught, or practiſed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary or not oppoſed it, that heereby they might come to condemne the practiſe of the Romane church, and condemne general Councels of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in faith; all which the <hi>Knight</hi> was pleaſed to paſſe ouer, putting downe onely thoſe other, which he thought he might make better ſport withall: for which purpoſe he alſo altereth <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's</hi> words: for whereas he ſpeaketh of a little paines, &amp; noe great charges <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſaith nothing of paines &amp; for charges he ſaith the quite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; to witt, that the charge is very great in ſome places, and in others that there is not wine to be had ſufficient for the people, but onely very little

for the Prieſt to ſay Maſſe, withall and for alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Chriſt's inſtitution <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſaith the expreſſe contrary, to wit, that it is an error to ſay that there is any ſuch inſtitution; and that there is noe more neceſſary by diuine inſtitution, but that we doe not contemne it as, ſaith he, Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors teach of Confirmation and Extreame Vnc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which are ſaid to be Sacraments not of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.

            <p>The third place is pag. 204. in his §. of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, where citing an authority of the ciuill law, he ſaith that the good Emperours <hi>Valens</hi> and
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:2521:297"/>
               <hi>Theodoſius</hi> made proclamation &amp;c. in the anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weare of which place, beſide other errors I ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed him for calling Valens a good Emperour; now in this 4. edition he leaueth out the word (good) whether by chance or vpon better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration I know not: howſoeuer I thought fitt to note it as a thing wherein the edition dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt place is pag. 319. in his 17. ſection where explicating what manner of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt it is that many be ſaued, he ſaith out of <hi>Hooker</hi> it muſt not be a Pope with the necke of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour vnder his feete, nor a Cardinal riding his horſe to the bridle in the blood of ſaints, but a Pope, a Cardinal ſorrowful, poenitent, diſro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, ſtript, not onely of vſurped power, but alſo reclaimed and recalled from his error, whoſe proſelytes muſt abiure all their hereſies wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they haue any way peruerted the truth &amp;c. All this and ſomewhat more of the ſame kind is added; which I doe not recite to anſwear: for I haue done that fully before, beſids that any man may ſee the abſurdity of it: for he may as well ſay any Iew, Turke, or heretique may be ſaued, to wit, by abiuring his errors, and being ſory for his ſinnes, and ſoe we ſay <hi>Sir Humphrey Linde</hi> himſelfe may be ſaued in this manner. I doe not therefore note this to anſweare but onely as I ſaid before to shew the difference of the editions and how with the number of them the meaſure of the <hi>Knight's</hi> malice encreaſeth: and ſoe much for that matter.</p>
